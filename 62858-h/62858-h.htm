  <h2 class='c003'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>This volume covers about one-eighth part of the miscellaneous
works of Plutarch known as the <i>Moralia</i>, much the
same quantity as is contained in Professor Tucker’s volume of
this series which appeared in 1913. All the pieces now offered
are in the form of dialogue, except the short treatise <i>On
Superstition</i>, which seemed to justify its inclusion by a certain
affinity of thought.</p>

<p class='c005'>The text followed is that of Wyttenbach, issued by the
Clarendon Press in 1795-1800, or rather a text compounded
of the Greek text there printed, his own critical notes and
revision of the old Latin version, his commentary, where one
exists, and his posthumous Index of Greek words used by
Plutarch (1830). A few corrections by C. F. Hermann,
Emperius, Madvig, and other scholars, have been introduced,
for many of which I am indebted, in the first place, as I have
acknowledged more particularly, to M. G. N. Bernardakis,
the accomplished editor of the <i>Moralia</i> in the Teubner series
(1888-96). A very few fresh corrections, mostly on obvious
points, have been admitted.</p>

<p class='c005'>The notes at the foot of the page are intended to show all
deviations from Wyttenbach’s text, so constituted, or to give
references to the authors of passages quoted by Plutarch;
there may be a few exceptions, where an illustrative reference
or an obvious explanation is given. For the plays and fragments
of the Tragic Poets reference is made to Dindorf’s
<i>Poetae Scenici</i>; for Pindar and other lyric poets, to Bergk’s
<i>Poetae Lyrici Graeci</i> (ed. 1900); for the fragments of Heraclitus,
to Bywater’s <i>Heracliti Ephesii reliquiae</i> (Oxford, 1877);
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>those of other early philosophers will be found in their places
in Diels’ <i>Vorsokratiker</i> (1903) or other collections.</p>

<p class='c005'>To four of the dialogues I have with some reluctance
prefixed a short running analysis. It is always a pity to anticipate
what the author puts clearly before us;<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c006'><sup>[1]</sup></a> but there is
here a real practical difficulty, even for a careful reader, in
being sure who is the speaker for the time being; and as he
is often introduced by the pronouns ‘I’ or ‘he’, no typographical
device quite serves. The other dialogues seem to
explain themselves sufficiently. There is no attempt to supply
a commentary; but it is hoped that the full index of proper
names (which are very numerous) will enable a reader to distinguish
those as to whom it is worth his while to inquire
further from those who are only of passing interest. I have
given here a good many references to other works of Plutarch,
but more may usefully be sought, for instance in such an
index as is appended to Clough’s edition of the <i>Lives</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>I may perhaps be allowed to mention that the dialogue
<i>On the Face which appears on the Orb of the Moon</i> was translated
by me, and tentatively published in 1911, with the hope
of obtaining some helpful criticism. Having received several
kind notices, and in particular a very full one in <i>Hermathena</i>
by Dr. L. G. Purser, to which I am deeply indebted, I have
now ventured to reproduce this dialogue in somewhat fuller
form than the others, and to retain some of my original
notes. I should add that I have no competence to deal with
any scientific matters as such. I have added two longer notes
on special points of interest.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sir Thomas Browne, writing in 1681-2 to his son Edward
who was by way of translating the <i>Lives</i> of Plutarch, and in
fact accomplished two of them, assumes that he will in the
main follow Amyot’s version, which North had followed
absolutely, and suggests that, with some corrections and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_v'>v</span>removal of obsolete words, North’s work might still serve
‘especially with gentlemen, who if the expression bee playne
looke not into criticisme’. ‘If you have the Greek Plutarke,’
he writes, ‘have also the Latin adjoyned unto it, so you may
consult either upon occasion, though you apply yourself to
translate out of French, and the English translation may be
sometimes helpful.’ Very likely an acceptable version of the
<i>Moralia</i> might now be produced out of Amyot and Philemon
Holland, a racy and scholarly translator from the Greek,
with the original and the old Latin at hand for reference.
But Dr. Edward Browne was a physician, of little leisure
and of delicate health, and it might hardly be respectful to
Plutarch to adopt this procedure now; indeed it seems to
recall that of ‘the dog’ in the proverb, who ‘drinks from the
Nile’, running as he drinks, always with an eye on the crocodiles.
However this may be, some indulgence may fairly be
claimed by a translator of an author, who, however straight-forward
himself, abounds in allusion and latent quotation,
and also in difficulties of text not of his own making, and
upon whom no commentary exists. I will mention, for the
sake of clearness, two instances as to which I have troubled
myself and, I fear, others a good deal:</p>

<p class='c005'>In the dialogue <i>On the Genius of Socrates</i>, chap. iii, end
(577 <span class='fss'>A</span>), the speaker says that his brother Epaminondas is
keeping out of the patriotic enterprise in hand, on the ground
that the more hot-headed members of the party will not stop
short of a general massacre and the murder of many of the
leading citizens.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have followed the Latin version in so rendering the words
καὶ διαφθεῖραι πολλοὺς τῶν διαφερόντων. But I have felt
some doubt—needlessly, I think—whether the Greek participle
would bear this meaning, and also whether the sense so given
is strong and suitable. Wyttenbach felt doubts too, for in his
posthumous <i>Index</i>, s.v. διαφέρω, the rendering given is ‘hostes
vel amici’, i.e. ‘friends or foes’. The sense is excellent, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>seems hardly to be in the Greek; probably it was a mere query
or jotting. The Teubner editor prints τῶν ἰδίᾳ διαφόρων ὄντων,
i.e. ‘those with whom they had private differences’, giving
Cobet’s name for the last two words. I have not been able to
trace the reference in Cobet, but in <i>Novae Lectiones</i>, p. 565, he
examines instances where he thinks that ἰδίᾳ should be supplied
or suppressed, as the case may be, before compounds of διά.
The sense seems good, but too special to be introduced into a
text without cogent evidence, since, once given currency, it is
difficult for a future critic to go back upon it. Meanwhile, in
Wyttenbach’s note on ii, 75 <span class='fss'>A</span>, he collects many instances where
οἱ διάφοροι is used by Plutarch for ‘the enemy’, ‘the other
party’, and τῶν διαφερόντων may have grown out of τῶν διαφόρων
with τῶν repeated. I have thought it the more peaceable
course to preserve the old rendering. I only quote this instance,
which is of no great importance but is of some, as one where
a <i>Variorum</i> editor would have stated at length and evaluated
the possible alternatives. That a translator should do so is
perhaps a case of ‘putting the cart before the horse’.</p>

<p class='c005'>The other instance is one of real interest, where the problem
is perhaps insoluble upon our present knowledge. In the
long dialogue <i>On the Cessation of the Oracles</i>, c. 20 (420 c.),
where Cleombrotus has been pressing a view that there may
be daemons with a long, but yet a limited, term of existence,
against the Epicureans, whose own strange theory of <i>Eidola</i>
he derides, Ammonius replies in words which appear thus in
the Latin:</p>

<p class='c005'>‘Recte, inquit, mihi pronunciare videtur Theophrastus,
quid enim obstat quin sententiam gravissimam et philosophiae
convenientissimam recipiamus dicentis: opinionem de Daemonibus,
si reiciatur, multa eorum simul abolere quae fieri
possunt demonstratione autem carent; <i>sin admittatur multa
secum trahere impossibilia et quae non exstiterint</i>.’</p>

<p class='c005'>Amyot and others write ‘Cleombrotus’ for ‘Theophrastus’,
a change which, in view of Plutarch’s carelessness as to personal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>names, seems not unlikely, and helps a little. No doubt
Theophrastus is quoted, but his name need not have been
mentioned, and may have been brought into the text in the
wrong place. The absurdity of the words which I have given
in italics seems evident, and I have returned to a suggestion
of Xylander,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c006'><sup>[2]</sup></a> by introducing a negative before πολλά, assuming
that Theophrastus is quoted, not for any opinion about
daemons, but for a canon of what is logically ‘probable’.
More subtle solutions are suggested, which could not be discussed
here properly: the question seems too intricate to
be settled by a translator as he goes on his way. We really
want to know what Theophrastus said.</p>

<p class='c005'>The remarks on the absence of a commentary do not apply
to the dialogue on <i>Instances of Delay in Divine Punishment</i>, fully
annotated by Wyttenbach in 1772, nor to the essay <i>On Superstition</i>
and the greater part of <i>The E at Delphi</i>, which are
dealt with in his continuous commentary. Nor should I omit
to mention the great help afforded by Kepler’s notes on the
<i>Face in the Moon</i> and his scholarly translation.</p>

<p class='c005'>The large number of poetical quotations in Plutarch often
stop a translator’s hand. Wherever it is possible, I have turned
to standard versions: for Homer to that of Worsley completed
by Conington, for Pindar’s extant Odes to that of
Bishop George Moberly, which it has been an especial pleasure
to use; for some lines of the <i>Cyclops</i> of Euripides I have been
fortunate enough to draw upon Shelley. There remain a good
many fragments, some of them of real poetical quality, and
some jingling oracles and the like; for the latter doggerel is
the proper vehicle, for the former the best attainable doggerel
must serve. The range of Plutarch’s poetical quotations
seems strangely limited considering their number. All are
Greek, and most from the older poets; indeed, with the exception
of a few from the New Comedy, nearly all might have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>been used by Plato. Those from the Tragedians are always
to the point, but he does not appear to care from which of the
three he is borrowing.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c006'><sup>[3]</sup></a> Homer and Hesiod always bring a
welcome flavour of an older world. Perhaps Pindar is the poet
whom he quotes with most hearty appreciation. Though he
has given us many new poetical fragments, he introduces us
to few, if any, new poets. Of Bacchylides there are only two
slight quotations in all Plutarch’s works. A single reference
to a passage of Horace is all that shows a knowledge of the
existence of Roman poetry.</p>

<p class='c005'>Southey’s comparison between the <i>Moralia</i> and the <i>Lives</i>
need not be pressed; it is the scholar’s preference for the
rare, which is his by privilege, over the popular. But it is
well to realize, as it is easy to do with the help of indices,
that the author’s hand is one in both. It is agreed that the
<i>Lives</i> belong to Plutarch’s later years, and were written at
Chaeroneia, under the limitations of his own library; the
several books appeared at intervals, of what length we cannot
say.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c006'><sup>[4]</sup></a> The few indications of date mentioned in the introductions
to the dialogues now before us suggest the later
part of Vespasian’s reign or the years nearly following it, say
from <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 80 on. The dialogue on the <i>Instances of Delay in
Divine Punishment</i> from its simpler psychology and demonology,
and perhaps from some crudity in style, suggests a date
earlier than that of some of the others. Dr. Max Adler, in his
lucid and learned dissertation, has established the close connexion
between the <i>Face in the Moon</i> and the <i>Cessation of
the Oracles</i>, and thinks the former to have been the earlier,
and to have been utilized for the latter piece.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c006'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>Montaigne, who knew his Plutarch up and down, has said
that he is one of the authors whom he likes to take after the
manner of the Danaids,<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c006'><sup>[6]</sup></a> which may be described as a
method of ‘dip and waste’. You may dip anywhere, as you
may into the pages of <i>The Doctor</i>, and be sure of finding something
which you would wish to remember; but you may also
find, on re-reading the same passage, that you have not remembered
it at all, so that the waste is continual. The freshness
need not be impaired by a little more system; indeed
it would be enhanced, at least for the dialogues, for this reason,
that they all represent real conversations between real persons,
and it is worth our while to put together our impressions about
each. The fullest materials for such an attempt will be found
in the <i>Symposiacs</i> or dialogues over wine.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c006'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>The <i>Symposiacs</i> are arranged in nine books, each of which
contains ten conversations of unequal length, but all short,
except the last which has fifteen. On the other hand nine,
viz. four of the fourth book and five of the last, are missing,
only the titles being preserved. All the books are dedicated
to Sossius Senecio, who was consul first in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 99; and as
there is no reference to the dignity, we may perhaps infer
that all were written before that year.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c006'><sup>[8]</sup></a> There is not a single
reference in all the nine books to any public or personal event
which might help us to a date. We hear of the ‘year’ of
officials of the Greek games, of Plutarch’s return from a visit
to Alexandria, and of a marriage in his family, which Sossius
Senecio attended, but we cannot follow these clues.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c006'><sup>[9]</sup></a> Many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>of the discussions are about wine and wine-parties; in others
the range of subject is very wide, from ‘What Plato meant
by saying, if he did say, that God geometrizes’ to ‘Whether
the table should be cleared after dinner’, or ‘Why truffles
grow after thunder’. A good many are on medical subjects;
in one of them the promising problem, ‘Whether new diseases
can arise, and from what causes’, is well argued. The physicians
present show a full knowledge of the Natural History found
in the works of Aristotle and Theophrastus, and the laymen
seem to argue with them on equal terms. There is little or no
pleasantry about professional habits, the fees or the pedantry,
except that in one party a physician is host, and sets on the
table an inordinately good dinner, while certain young men of
severe habits put him to a great deal of trouble to produce
some cheese to eat with their dry bread.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c006'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>In the first dialogue of the First Book the question is raised,
‘Whether philosophy may be discussed over wine’. The
answer appears to be ‘Why not?’ but probably none of the
following dialogues would be called ‘philosophical’ by philosophers.
Plutarch loved a vigorous set-to, with no quarter given,
‘nothing for hate, but all for honour’, as much as did Montaigne.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c006'><sup>[11]</sup></a>
But he felt deeply about the matters at issue between
Stoics and Epicureans, the two schools which mattered.
Believing himself in a Providence, kindly and particular,
associated by him with the Apollo of Delphi, he disliked equally
the Epicurean who flouted a Providence, and the Stoic who
lowered it by his pedantry and contradictions. He would not
have a scene over the wine. Even in the daylight dialogues
now before us, the cynic ‘Planetiades’ is skilfully bowed out
before there is trouble, and ‘Epicurus’ takes himself off before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>the reported discussion begins, leaving the company surprised
rather than angry.</p>

<p class='c005'>The titles of the five lost dialogues of the last book (the
others of that book being all on literary subjects) are curious.
Three are connected with music; and I should have the
permission of those who have kindly helped me here to say
that there is about Greek music a considerable region of dim
penumbra. Another raises a question discussed in the <i>De
Facie</i> and answered there out of Aristotle and Posidonius,
as to the eclipses of sun and moon. Another is on the problem
‘Whether the total number of the stars is more probably even
than odd’. The speakers (for a fragment is preserved) are
quite aware that a game of odd-and-even on such a scale might
seem childish. It need not be so, if the treatment were like
that of the <i>Arenarius</i> of Archimedes (all the better if in his
Doric); it would then have contained some long numbers
and some stiff reasoning. Of one thing we may be sure, that
if Lamprias, who is much to the fore in the Ninth Book,
took a part, he was ready with a received view, framed on
the spot.</p>

<p class='c005'>M. Bernardakis<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c006'><sup>[12]</sup></a> (who quotes a letter from M. Wessely) tells
us that in the Paris E there is a blank space here of 2-¼ leaves,
but that in the old Vienna MS., no. 148 (which contains the
<i>Symposiacs</i> only), three whole pages have been cut out, leaving
a gap between what remains of the sixth dialogue and the
fragment of the twelfth. Former editions had printed continuously,
and our gratitude is due to M. Bernardakis for
his restitution of the fragment to its proper place. The
inference appears to be that the Vienna MS. is here the parent,
though why the fragment stops short where it does is not
clear. Probably the scribe was daunted by the technical
language, and either left a blank space to be filled up by some
one of greater experience, or so spoilt his sheets by errors and
erasures that it was better to cut them out. Some such cause
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>has been conjectured for the many gaps left in E, occurring
where the subject-matter is difficult.</p>

<p class='c005'>Some ninety different persons are mentioned by name as
taking part in the <i>Symposiac Dialogues</i>, and if we allow for the
lost pieces, there must have been at least a hundred. These
may be arranged in groups: Plutarch and his family—his
grandfather, father, brothers, sons, sons-in-law—the doctors (8),
the grammarians (5), and so on. Many of these reappear in
the dialogues now before us, and much may be gained in
distinctness of personality by following out the references
given.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c006'><sup>[13]</sup></a> Ammonius, Plutarch’s teacher in the Platonic philosophy,
comes out as a masterful person, and a past-master in
the art of tactful arrangement of a debate. Theon (‘Our
Comrade’, an appellation given to some half-dozen others),
to be distinguished from ‘Theon the Grammarian’, is a close
and much trusted family friend. Very few Roman names
appear, but Sossius Senecio, Mestrius Florus, and one or two
others, must have been intimates.</p>

<p class='c005'>None of the conversations in the <i>Symposiacs</i> turn upon
points which were Plutarch’s interest when he wrote the
<i>Lives</i>; the study of character in stirring times, of the reaction
of circumstances upon character and of character upon circumstances,
of the insoluble problem which is always solving
itself, as to ‘Virtue’ on the one hand and ‘Fortune’ on the
other, determining success. The elaborate introduction to
the <i>Genius of Socrates</i>, put side by side with that to the <i>Life
of Pericles</i>, shows that the author wished to turn from subjects
which made good talk over wine in hours of leisure, to
others of a more virile stamp. The most convenient hypothesis
would be that the success of the <i>Symposiacs</i> suggested
to the author to try his hand on more elaborate dialogue,
and that, still later on, he settled to the <i>Lives</i> in the spirit,
not of an historian, but of an artist, filling his canvas with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>themes inspired by that great art, Virtue. The lost <i>Life of
Epaminondas</i>, his favourite hero, would have told us a great
deal about the artist himself. It was not Plutarch’s habit
to sum up in such brilliant character sketches as stand out
in other historians: this has been done for Epaminondas, on
broad and generous lines, by Sir Walter Raleigh, and before
him, not less generously, by Montaigne; and much material
will be found scattered among Plutarch’s other <i>Lives</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Such an hypothesis can only be ventured in the broadest
outline, for no one date covers all the <i>Lives</i> or all the <i>Dialogues</i>,
and some of the facts are perplexing. In the <i>Second Pythian
Dialogue</i> Diogenianus appears as a very young man, and is
introduced as the son of a father known to the company;
and Diogenianus of Pergamum takes part in several of the
<i>Symposiacs</i>, but there is no mention of a son old enough to
be brought with him. On the other hand, Boethus in the
same dialogue is ‘on his way to the camp of the Epicureans’;
in one of the <i>Symposiacs</i> he is ‘an Epicurean’ simply. In
the last book of the <i>Symposiacs</i> Theon’s sons come in, but we
do not hear of him elsewhere as a father of grown-up sons.</p>

<p class='c005'>The dialogue <i>On the Face which appears on the Orb of the
Moon</i> is unique as showing the interest taken by men of good
general education in scientific subjects in the first century of
our era, and as evidence of the point to which the natural
sciences had then attained. Professional science may be said
to have been almost limited to the province of the mathematician
and his congeners. Natural History was part of the
general outfit of the ‘Philosophers’, and there was no idea
of the ‘Conquest of Nature’ for the relief of man’s estate,
unless by the engineer or the physician. With these limitations,
the progress made may strike some modern readers as
surprisingly great, and a good example may be found in the
very precise knowledge of Hipparchus and Ptolemy of the delicate
phenomena of the moon’s movements. We are tempted
to ask whether, if Greeks had not settled these problems,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>which men of no other ancient race attacked scientifically,
they would have been settled to this day. To come down to
a humbler matter: if the properties of the conic sections had
not been discovered by Apollonius and his predecessors, would
they stand in their place, probably a modest one, on a modern
syllabus, and, meanwhile, could the mechanical arts have progressed
without them? And the conic sections are simple
things compared with the lines, surfaces, and solids determined
once for all by Archimedes. Archimedes was a mathematician
by the grace of Nature, and an engineer by the order of a
prince; and the conic sections themselves were examined, not
from any practical interest in the cone, but because they were
found to furnish instances of the curves which might facilitate
the line of inquiry, suggested by Plato with such amazing foresight,
as a half-way house towards a solution of Apollo’s
problem.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c006'><sup>[14]</sup></a> Of course this can only be stated as a question—not
a rhetorical question—and must be left on the knees of the
gods. The general subject is discussed in D. Ruhnken’s admirable
<i>De Graecia artium ac doctrinarum inventrice</i>, an inaugural
lecture delivered at Leyden in 1757 (just thirty years after
Newton’s death).</p>

<p class='c005'>A few lines about the scholar to whose prolonged labours
upon Plutarch we owe so much are only his due. Daniel
Wyttenbach was born at Bern, where his father was a divine
of good Swiss family, in 1746. He studied at Marburg and
Göttingen, and passed to Holland, filling professorial chairs
at Amsterdam, and, from 1798, at Leyden. In Holland he
was the colleague and intimate friend of Valckenaer (1715-85)
and David Ruhnken (1723-98), himself by birth a German.
By their advice, he turned from a meditated edition of the
Emperor Julian’s works to Plutarch. The two advisers were
not quite at one, and Wyttenbach seemed to crouch between
two burdens—Valckenaer wished him to produce a final edition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>of some one work, Ruhnken (who would gladly have faced the
task himself if he had been a younger man) preferred that he
should not stop short of all Plutarch. In 1772 he produced
his learned and complete commentary on the <i>De sera numinum
Vindicta</i>. About this time the Delegates of the Oxford Press
were anxious to produce a worthy edition of a great classic;
and in 1788 Thomas Burgess, Fellow of Corpus Christi College,
afterwards Bishop of St. Davids and of Salisbury, visited Holland
and sought an introduction to Wyttenbach, with whom an
arrangement was concluded in the autumn of that year. The
issue of the volumes of text, with critical notes and revised
Latin version, began in 1795 and went on steadily till 1797;
but there was much delay and many searchings of heart over
the last volume, containing the fragments, the dispatch of
which was hindered by the state of war and the occupation
of Holland by foreign troops. It was at last discovered
in 1800 in the port of Hamburg, and appears to have reached
Oxford in that year. The first two volumes of the commentary,
to page 242 <span class='fss'>C</span>, had preceded it in 1798, and were also published
in 1800. The last volume must have proceeded slowly, for it
had only reached 392 <span class='fss'>D</span>, near the end of the <i>E at Delphi</i>, when,
on January 12, 1807, it was interrupted by an explosion due
to the careless use of fire on a barge loaded with gunpowder.
The effects of the conflagration which followed are visible in
Leyden to this day. The disaster was ill-timed for us, for the
commentary stops just short of a passage of great interest
(see p. <a href='#Page_75'>75</a>). Wyttenbach bore this trouble, which he has
graphically described in several letters, and also those caused
by ill health and narrowed means, with much fortitude. He
died in 1820, and the last volume of the commentary was
sent to Oxford and published in 1821, followed by the two
volumes of the <i>Index Graecitatis</i> in 1830. He was a most
amiable man, and the letters which passed between him and
Ruhnken have much charm of feeling and expression. Both
wrote in admirable Latin; Wyttenbach’s style is always fluent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>and picturesque, but has certain idiosyncrasies, which may
delay an English reader.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c006'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>Of older scholars who had dealt with Plutarch, by far
the most important was Turnebus<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c006'><sup>[16]</sup></a> (1512-65). Of Xylander
(W. Holzmann, 1532-76), who produced the Latin translation,
the basis of his own commentary, and a Greek text, Wyttenbach
writes with much respect and sympathy, as he does also of
Reiske (1716-74), his own contemporary, who, however, was
not quite adequately equipped, in point of material or of
critical judgement.</p>

<p class='c005'>I should like to express my deep sense of the loss caused to
classical scholarship by the lamented death of Herbert Richards.
I have more than once referred to his critical notes on the
<i>Moralia</i>, which have been appearing lately in the <i>Classical
Review</i>: many of the finer points of Greek idiom do not
concern a translator, but there are several most valuable
suggestions and criticisms which I have felt confidence in
adopting.</p>

<p class='c005'>A still more personal loss, which intimately concerns this
volume, is that of Ingram Bywater. He had promised a
revision of it in its passage through the press; and his vigilance
as a Curator as well as his jealousy for the severer traditions of
scholarship, apart from his personal kindness, would, I know,
have made it a searching one. He did not specially care for
English translation, and his own masterly version of the <i>Poetics</i>
of Aristotle is prefaced by something like a protest. Nor did
he feel much sympathy with what he would call the ‘Realien’.
On the realities of life no one had a saner or better informed
judgement. For natural science and its representatives he
cherished a genuine respect; and perhaps none of the tributes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>to his memory would have touched him more than one which
was paid in the pages of <i>Nature</i> by an old colleague and friend
of the Exeter College days. But he had a certain shyness of
the intrusion of arguments based, say, upon geometry or
music, into problems of language already sufficiently perplexed.
How generously his noble library and his own stores
of wisdom were thrown open to those who sought them
is known to many, as it is to myself.</p>

<p class='c005'>Yet another great loss to me has been that of the Rev. David
Thomas, Rector of Garsington, in Oxfordshire, a veteran
mathematician, my near neighbour and most kindly and
helpful referee during many years.</p>

<p class='c005'>I cannot send out even so small a volume without a word
of gratitude for affectionate and lifelong help received from
John Wordsworth, Bishop of Salisbury 1885-1911. His own
enduring contribution to secular scholarship was made in
1874, and holds its place in the judgement of Latin scholars.
He was always shouldering new burdens, the last being the
mastering, for a definite purpose of friendship and public duty,
of the language and history of Sweden. But his great stores
of books and of knowledge were always in order, and always made
available to others. He would often preface any opinion of
his own by ‘My father used to think highly’ of such a book
or such a person; and it was always well to be reminded of that
true scholar and most courteous gentleman of an older day.</p>

<p class='c005'>I owe much, for help and advice, to living friends whom
I should like to thank, but may not. But I must be allowed to
acknowledge, in no conventional spirit, the great care bestowed
on these pages by the Reader for the Delegates of the Press,
who has entered into difficulties of matter as well as of language
as few scholars can be expected to have the patience
to do.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c006'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>The style of Plutarch has not received much favour with
scholars. He uses too many words, and writes in cumbrous
sentences, and the words often seem ill-shapen. But it has
merits which are acknowledged by all those who have dwelt
much upon him. His style is a very honest one; at the end of
the longest sentence it is always found that he has said something
worth saying, and that no word can be retrenched as
mere verbiage. And he is so much in earnest that he often
reaches an eloquence, which burns, perhaps, with a dull glow,
but which cannot be quite lost in any translation. Indeed the
modern languages have sometimes an advantage in the fact
that they do not possess counterparts, as long and as elaborate,
of the terms used in the original. Of the first, and the best, of
Plutarch’s translators, Montaigne<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c006'><sup>[18]</sup></a> has written an opinion,
to which it should be added that, in the judgement of very
capable persons, Amyot<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c006'><sup>[19]</sup></a> was a scholar of real knowledge and
penetration, though he is sometimes content to paraphrase:</p>

<p class='c005'>‘Ie donne avecque raison, ce me semble, la palme à Iacques
Amyot sur touts nos escrivains françois, non seulement pour
la naïfveté et pureté du langage, en quoy il surpasse touts
aultres, ny pour la constance d’un si long travail, ny pour la
profondeur de son sçavoir, ayant peu developper si heureusement
un aucteur si espineux et ferré (car on m’en dira ce qu’on
vouldra, ie n’entends rien au grec, mais ie veois un sens si bien
ioinct et entretenu partout en sa traduction, que, ou il a
certainement entendu l’imagination vraye de l’aucteur, ou
ayant, par longue conversation, planté vifvement dans son
ame une generale idee de celle de Plutarque, il ne luy a au
moins rien presté qui le desmente ou qui le desdie); mais,
sur tout, ie luy sçais bon gré d’avoir seu trier et choisir un
livre si digne et si à propos pour en faire present à son pais.’</p>

<p class='c005'>Since this Preface was written, early in 1916, a study of
Plutarch, which should be of great value to his readers, has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>appeared in the <i>De Plutarcho scriptore et philosopho</i>, by Professor
J. J. Hartman of Leyden. Professor Hartman is an enthusiast,
and his book covers all the works of Plutarch, the <i>Moralia</i> and
the <i>Lives</i>, their relations to one another and to the author’s
career. He is of opinion that the <i>Lives</i> were taken in hand after
all, or nearly all, the writings included in the <i>Moralia</i> were completed,
and then appeared in rapid succession of books. He
observes that many of the pieces of the <i>Moralia</i> suggest the date
<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 107; the <i>Symposiacs</i> he places somewhat later. Two
conclusions, of much importance as coming from so serious a
student, may be stated: the Christian teaching had never come
into Plutarch’s hearing (p. 114, &amp;c.), and there is no suggestion
of any tendency to Oriental or Neoplatonic thought; Plutarch
was the best living authority on Plato and his works, and aimed
at being the Plato of his own day (pp. 389, 680, &amp;c.).</p>

<p class='c005'>A large list of critical comments is appended to the general
notice of each work. Professor Hartman takes as his basis the
Teubner edition, and pays a well-merited tribute to the care
and skill of M. Bernardakis (p. 237, &amp;c.). His usual complaint is
that the editor has lacked the boldness to incorporate in the text
ingenious emendations which he mentions in notes. I had myself
felt somewhat differently as to all unsupported emendations,
though I am glad to repeat my sense of the great usefulness of the
edition, my debt to which goes much beyond what I have
expressly acknowledged.</p>

  <h2 id='chap01' class='c003'>ON THE GENIUS OF SOCRATES</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c009'>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p class='c004'>The Dialogue on <i>The Genius of Socrates</i>, to follow the familiar
Latin title, is in the main a detailed and spirited account of
a gallant exploit, the recovery of the Cadmeia, or citadel of
Thebes, treacherously taken by the Spartans, with the aid of
the Theban oligarchs, two years before. The recovery was
effected in the winter of 379-378 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> by a party of Theban
patriots, returning from exile in Athens, led by Pelopidas.
The discussions as to the real meaning of the ‘daemonic Sign’
of Socrates form interludes which fill in the hours of waiting,
and serve to relieve the tension of the narrative. It is as though
Ulysses were heard discoursing to Menelaus within the Wooden
Horse on the personality of Pallas Athene, with Helen prowling
around outside. There is nothing strained or dramatic, in any
disparaging sense, in speculation thus rubbing shoulders with
action. The simplicity and good faith of the speakers, and the
attractive personality of Epaminondas, forbid any suspicion of
affectation. Thus the Dialogue serves a double purpose: it
redeems the character of the leading Thebans, and of Pelopidas
in particular, from the habitual disparagement of Xenophon and
others; and it redeems the intellectual character of the Boeotians
from the reproach against which the most brilliant of Greek
poets, himself a son of Thebes, protests, ‘Swine of Boeotia’.
For the chief speaker on the Socratic question is Simmias, and
Cebes is present, Thebans whose names are for ever associated
with the last hours of the Athenian Master; and the story is
brightened by glimpses into the home of Epaminondas, and by
hallowed memories of the Pythagorean brotherhood.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>Early in 382 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> the Spartans had dispatched a force against
Olynthus, the first division under Eudamidas, the second under
his brother Phoebidas. The latter lingered under the walls of
Thebes; and, whether led by personal ambition, or receiving
secret orders from home, allowed himself to intrigue with the
oligarchical leaders, who, though their party was not in power,
were strong enough to be represented on the board of Polemarchs
by Leontides, another, or the other, being Ismenias. Guided
by Leontides, the Spartans, one hot summer day, seized the
Cadmeia; Leontides arrested his colleague Ismenias, and caused
Archias to be made Polemarch in his place. The popular
leaders, some four hundred in number, took refuge in Athens.
The Spartans disclaimed the action of Phoebidas, who was fined
and superseded; and appropriated its results, strengthening the
garrison of the Cadmeia. A commission of judges from the
confederate states was appointed by Sparta to try Ismenias on
a vague charge of Medizing; he was condemned and executed.
Of the two Polemarchs, Archias was a man of pleasure, Leontides
one of severe private life, but an unscrupulous party leader. He
caused the lives of the refugees in Athens to be attempted,
successfully in at least one case, that of Androcleidas. Of the
patriots, Pelopidas, who had been formally exiled, was the
leading spirit; Epaminondas, who remained at home, held back
for good reasons which are stated in the course of the Dialogue
(p. <a href='#Page_9'>9</a>). One of the most useful confederates was Phyllidas;
he had himself, when on a visit to Athens, suggested the enterprise,
but he managed to retain the confidence of the party now
in possession of Thebes, and held the office of Secretary to the
Polemarchs.</p>

<p class='c005'>These facts are assumed to be familiar to his hearers by
Capheisias, brother of Epaminondas, who had himself joined
the liberators without any scruples, and later on had been sent
to Athens on an embassy. His story of the sequel is told to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>a mixed company of Athenians and Thebans. It is a perfectly
clear one, and needs no comment.</p>

<p class='c005'>The facts are again told by Plutarch in his <i>Life of Pelopidas</i>.
The <i>Lives</i> were the work of his later years; and the present
Dialogue, with its fuller detail and more varied colouring, is an
earlier attempt to draw an historical picture, a work of art
which will bear the close inspection of those who love to hear
of virtue, or valour, in action.</p>

<p class='c005'>The events are also narrated by Xenophon, who, from his
usual Lacedaemonian and anti-Theban bias, omits all mention
of Pelopidas. Thirlwall has preferred to base his account upon
Plutarch; Grote follows Xenophon, but with a strong protest
against his narrowness.</p>

<p class='c005'>The conduct of Sparta justifies the allegation made by the
Athenians in 416 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, ‘that in her political transactions she
measured honour by inclination and justice by expediency’
(Thuc. 5, 105). The most scathing verdict upon it is delivered
by Xenophon himself, who pauses in his narrative to point the
moral, that the fall and degradation of Sparta began from this
turning-point:</p>

<p class='c005'>‘It would be possible to mention many other instances, from
Greek and foreign history, proving that the Gods do not fail to
notice the authors of impious and wicked deeds; at present
I shall only mention the case before us. The Lacedaemonians,
who had sworn that they would leave the cities independent,
and then seized the Acropolis of Thebes, were punished entirely
by those whom they had wronged, having previously been
beaten by no man then living. The Theban citizens who had
introduced them into the citadel, and who wished the city to be
subject to the Lacedaemonians that they themselves might enjoy
absolute power, lost their supremacy, which seven exiles were
enough to overthrow.’</p>

<p class='c005'>These remarks are in the spirit of the Greek Tragedians, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>love to bring into strong light an act or situation of pride and
insolence as the turning-point from prosperity to ruin. Thucydides,
as is pointed out by Grote in the masterly pages which
end his fifty-sixth chapter, has brought the cynical injustice of
the Athenians towards Melos into glaring prominence in order
to prepare his readers for the disastrous sequel.</p>

<p class='c005'>The problem of the true nature of the ‘Divine Sign’ of
Socrates is one of great interest and some mystery. The Latin
word ‘Genius’, the attendant spirit who makes each of us
what he is, in fact, his self, is familiar to us from Horace:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>The Genius, guardian of each child of earth,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Born when we’re born and dying when we die.</i></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(<i>Epist.</i> 2, 2, 187.)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The conception is thoroughly Greek, and may be paralleled
abundantly from Plato as well as from Plutarch himself and
contemporary writers. But it is really misapplied here, and is
in fact a mistranslation, since the word used by Plato and
Xenophon as well as by Plutarch is invariably not the daemon,
but the neuter adjective, ‘the daemonic sc. Sign’. The passages
of Plato and Xenophon are collected in the late James Riddell’s
edition of the <i>Apology</i> of Plato.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c006'><sup>[20]</sup></a> It is to be observed that in all
the genuine works of Plato the operation of the Sign is negative
and deterrent, in Xenophon it is sometimes positive and hortatory.
The reader should consult the articles on Socrates by
Professor Henry Jackson in the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>.
Professor Jackson is inclined to think that the evidence points
to some abnormal condition of the sense of hearing, and there
are expressions in this Dialogue of Plutarch which seem to bear
out such a view. Apuleius’ treatise <i>On the God of Socrates</i>
(which St. Augustine tells us that he would have entitled <i>On
the daemon of Socrates</i> if he had dared) tells us much which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>is of interest about the daemons, but not very much about
Socrates. He contributes, however, the pertinent remark
that the Sign, according to Socrates himself, was not ‘a voice’,
but ‘a sort of voice’.</p>

<p class='c005'>There is no indication of the date of composition of this
Dialogue.</p>

<p class='c005'>Not many points of topography arise. The Cadmeia stood
on a low hill or plateau rising from north to south on the eastern
side of the Dirce stream and reaching a height of some 200 feet,
now occupied by the modern town. The market-place was
north-east of this, near the river Ismenus. Of the seven famous
gates the returning exiles may probably have entered by the
Electran, the one assailed by Capaneus in Aeschylus’ story
(<i>Seven against Thebes</i>, 423).</p>

<p class='c004'>I. <i>Archidamus.</i> I once heard a painter, Capheisias, say a
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> striking thing about the different people who come to view
pictures, which he put as a simile. Spectators with no technical
knowledge, he said, are like those who greet a large company in
the mass; others, who possess fine taste and a love of art,
resemble those who have a personal word for all comers. The
former get only a general view of the works before them, which
is never accurate; the latter discuss each piece critically and in
detail, and no point of execution, good or bad, escapes inspection
and remark. Now I think that it is just the same with the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> actions of real life. Duller minds are satisfied if they learn from
history the summary account of what occurred and its outcome;
lovers of what is honourable and beautiful take keener delight in
hearing all particulars of the performances inspired by that great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Art Virtue. To the actual result, Fortune has much to say;
but he who dwells on causes and particulars sees Virtue at
odds with circumstance, acts of rational daring done in the
face of danger, and calculation meeting opportunity and passion.
Take it that we belong to the second class. Begin at the
beginning of the enterprise, and give us all the incidents and <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
all the speeches which were no doubt delivered in your presence;
and believe that I would not have hesitated to go to Thebes on
purpose to hear the story, but that the Athenians are already
beginning to think me too much of a Boeotian.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Capheisias.</i> Indeed, Archidamus, since you are so kind as to
press for the whole story, it would be my duty to make it, as
Pindar<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c006'><sup>[21]</sup></a> says, ‘a call before all business’ to come here to tell it;
but as we are brought here on an embassy, and have nothing
to do until we receive the answers of the people, I feel that
any reluctance or embarrassment on my part towards so kind
and good a friend might well wake up the old reproach against
the Boeotians that they hate discussion. It was already fading <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
away, thanks to your Socrates; but our own care for Lysis,<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c006'><sup>[22]</sup></a> of
blessed memory, showed us true enthusiasts. But see whom
we have present: is it convenient to them to listen to so long
a story and to so many speeches? The narrative is not a short
one, since you yourself bid me include the speeches.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Archidamus.</i> You do not know these friends, Capheisias?
No, but you should; sons of good fathers who were good friends
to your people. This is Lysitheides, nephew of Thrasybulus; <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
this is Timotheus, Conon’s son; these are the sons of Archinus;
the others are all of our brotherhood; so your story finds
a friendly and congenial audience.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Capheisias.</i> That is well. But what should you think a good
point for me to start from, in view of what you know already?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span><i>Archidamus.</i> We know fairly well, Capheisias, how things
were at Thebes before the return of the exiles. We had heard
at Athens how Archias and Leontides persuaded Phoebidas to
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>576<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> seize the Cadmeia during a truce; how they expelled some of
the citizens and terrorized others, and seized office for themselves
in defiance of law. We were the personal hosts here of
Melon and Pelopidas, and constantly in their company so long
as they were in exile. Again, we had heard how the Lacedaemonians
fined Phoebidas for seizing the Cadmeia, removed him
from the command against Olynthus, and then replaced him at
Thebes by Lysanoridas and two others, and kept a stronger
garrison than before in the Citadel. We were aware, too, how
Ismenias met an unworthy death, since, immediately after his
trial, Gorgidas wrote the whole account in a letter to the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> exiles here. Thus it remains for you to tell us about the actual
return of our friends and the capture of the tyrants.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <i>Capheisias.</i> Well then, Archidamus, during those days,
all of us who were concerned in the movement were accustomed
to meet for conference when necessary in the house of Simmias,
who was recovering from a wound in the leg; ostensibly passing
the time in philosophical talk, into which, as a blind, we often
drew Archias and Leontides, men not altogether strangers to
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> such discussion. For Simmias had spent much time abroad,
and wandered among men of other lands, and had shortly before
this returned to Thebes full of all sorts of stories and outlandish
accounts. These stories Archias used to enjoy when he chanced
to have leisure, taking his seat with the young men, and liking
us to pass the time in talk rather than attend to their proceedings.
On the day upon which the exiles were to reach the walls at
dusk, a man came in from here, sent by Pherenicus, known to
none of our party except Charon; he proceeded to explain
that the younger exiles, twelve in number, had taken hounds
to hunt the Cithaeron country, intending to reach Thebes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>towards evening. He had been sent, he said, in advance <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
to tell us this, and to find out who was to provide the house for
their concealment on arrival, so that they might have notice
and go straight to it. While we were puzzling it over, Charon
agreed to provide his own house. So the man settled to return
to the exiles as fast as he could.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. Here the prophet Theocritus pressed my hand hard,
and looking at Charon, who was walking in front, said: ‘This
man is no philosopher, Capheisias; he has received no extraordinary
training, as Epaminondas your brother has; yet you
see how he is naturally drawn by the laws towards the nobler <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
course, volunteering to encounter the greatest danger for our
country’s sake. Whereas Epaminondas, who claims to have
been trained to virtue above all Boeotians, is dull and spiritless;<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c006'><sup>[23]</sup></a>
what better opportunity than this will he ever have to bring
into play his fine gifts and training?’ I said: ‘Not so fast, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Theocritus the eager! We are carrying out what we ourselves
resolved; but Epaminondas, failing to persuade us to drop the
plan, as he thinks would be best, naturally resists when invited
to a course of action which he dislikes and disapproves. Suppose
a physician undertook to cure a disease without the use of knife
or fire: you would not be using him fairly, to my thinking, if
you compelled him to cut or burn.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c006'><sup>[24]</sup></a> Very well; my brother,
as you know, will not have any citizen die without a trial, yet
is eager to work with those who wish to free the city from
internal bloodshed and slaughter. As, however, he fails to
convince the majority, and as we have embarked on this course,
he bids you let him stand out, clear and guiltless of murder,
and free to watch opportunities; when justice and expediency <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>577<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
meet, he will strike in. He feels that, work once begun, there
will be no limitations; perhaps Pherenicus and Pelopidas will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>turn their attack against the greatest criminals, but Eumolpidas
and Samidas, men of fire and passion, when night puts power in
their hands, will not sheathe their swords before they have filled
the city with murder from end to end, and dispatched many
of our leading men.</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. While I was thus conversing with Theocritus, Galaxidorus
kept trying to check us;<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c006'><sup>[25]</sup></a> Archias was near, and Lysanoridas
the Spartan, both walking quickly from the Cadmeia,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> apparently towards the same point as ourselves. So we broke
off; Archias called Theocritus, and drew him towards Lysanoridas;
then he talked a long time with them apart, having
changed his direction a little towards the Amphion. Thus we
were in an agony: had some hint or information reached them,
upon which they were questioning Theocritus? In the meanwhile
Phyllidas, whom you know, Archidamus, and who was at
that time acting as clerk to Archias and the Polemarchs, and
knew of the expected arrival of the exiles,<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c006'><sup>[26]</sup></a> being privy to our
scheme, pressed my hand as it was his way to do, and went on
with bantering talk for every one’s benefit, about the gymnasia
and the wrestling; then, having drawn me some distance from
the others, he began to ask me about the exiles, and whether
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> they were keeping to their day. When I said that they were, he
continued: ‘Then I have done right in preparing for to-day the
party at which I mean to entertain Archias, and to deliver him
into their hand in his cups.’ ‘Better than right, Phyllidas!’
I said; ‘and do you try to collect all or as many as you can
of our enemies to the same place.’ ‘That is not easy;’ said
he, ‘indeed, it is impossible; for Archias, expecting that
a certain lady of high rank will come there to meet him, does
not wish Leontides to be present. We must therefore mark
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> them down to separate houses. If Archias and Leontides are
once captured, I think that the others will take themselves off,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>or else will remain quiet, glad to close with any offer of safety.’
‘We will do so,’ I said, ‘but what can Theocritus have to talk
about with these people?’ ‘I cannot answer clearly or from
knowledge,’ said Phyllidas, ‘but I heard portents mentioned
and prophecies disastrous to Sparta.’ <a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c006'><sup>[27]</sup></a>[Meanwhile Theocritus
rejoined us, and] Pheidolaus of Haliartus came up and said,
‘Simmias wants you to wait hereabouts a little. He is closeted
with Leontides, interceding for Amphitheus to get his sentence
of death commuted, if possible, to exile.’</p>

<p class='c005'>V. ‘The very man!’ said Theocritus. ‘You might <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
have come on purpose, for I was longing to hear what the
discoveries were, and about the general appearance of the tomb
of Alcmena in your country when it was opened, if you were
really present yourself when Agesilaus sent and removed the
remains to Sparta.’ Pheidolaus answered: ‘I was not present;
and vexed and indignant I was with my citizens for leaving me
out. However, no vestige of a body was found, only a bracelet
of brass, not a large one, and two earthenware jars containing <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
earth which had become solid as stone. Above the tomb lay
a brass plate, with many letters wonderful for their great
antiquity; they afforded no intelligible sense, though they
came out clear to the eye when the brass was washed. The
characters were of a peculiar and barbaric type, most closely
resembling the Egyptian; and Agesilaus accordingly, as they
said, sent copies to the king of Egypt, asking him to show them
to the priests, on the chance of their understanding them.
However, Simmias may, perhaps, have something to tell you
about all this, as he was at that time in Egypt, and philosophy <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>578<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
brought him much into the society of the priests. But the
people of Haliartus believe that the great scarcity of crops and
the advance of the lake were not accidental, but were an angry
visitation because they allowed the tomb to be dug open.’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>After a short pause Theocritus went on: ‘Nor yet are the
Lacedaemonians themselves clear of the wrath of heaven, as is
shown by the portents about which Lysanoridas was lately
conferring with us. He is now off to Haliartus to fill in the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> tomb again and to offer libations to Alcmena and Aleus, of course
in accordance with some oracle, not knowing who Aleus was.
When he comes back from there he intends to investigate the
tomb of Dirce, which is unknown to the Thebans, except those
who have acted as Hipparchs. The outgoing magistrate takes
his successor in office, with no one else present, and shows it him
at night; they perform certain fireless rites over the tomb,
carefully obliterate all traces, and go off under cover of darkness
by separate ways. And much chance, I think, they will have
of finding it, Pheidolaus! For most of those who have served
legally as Hipparchs are now in exile; I might say all, except
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Gorgidas and Plato, whom they fear too much to examine. But
the present magistrates receive the spear and the seal in the
Cadmeia, and know absolutely nothing.’</p>

<p class='c005'>VI. While Theocritus was saying this, Leontides was going
out with his friends. We entered, and began to pay our compliments
to Simmias, who was sitting on the couch, having
been unsuccessful in his petition, I think, for he seemed wrapped
in thought and much annoyed. Looking hard at us all, ‘Hercules!’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> he said, ‘what savage barbarous manners! How right,
and more than right, old Thales was, when he came home from
a long absence abroad, and his friends asked what was his rarest
discovery, “An aged tyrant”, he said! For every one, even if he
have not been personally wronged, is disgusted at mere oppression,
and harshness, and so is an enemy to lawless irresponsible
dynasties. Well, the God will see to this, perhaps; now,
Capheisias, about your newcomer, do you know who he is?’
‘I do not know’, said I, ‘whom you mean.’ ‘Yet Leontides
tells us’, he said, ‘that a man has been seen by the tomb of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Lysis, rising to go when night was done. His retinue and <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
equipment were stately. He had bivouacked there on a rough
bed, for piles of agnus castus and tamarisk were visible, and also
remains of burnt sacrifices and libations of milk. At dawn he
asked those who met him whether he should find the sons of
Polymnis in the country.’ ‘But who can the stranger be?’
I said; ‘from what you tell us it must be some uncommon
person, one in no private station.’</p>

<p class='c005'>VII. ‘Certainly not’, said Pheidolaus. ‘However, when
he comes we will see to his reception. Now, as to those characters,
Simmias, about which we were puzzling just now. If you
know more than we do, tell us; for it is said that the Egyptian
priests have made out the letters on the plate which Agesilaus <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
took from us when he opened the tomb of Alcmena.’ Simmias
remembered at once. ‘I know nothing of that plate, Pheidolaus;’
he said, ‘but Agenoridas the Spartan brought a number
of characters from Agesilaus to Memphis, to Chonuphis the
prophet, with whom Plato and I and Hellopion of Peparethus
were staying to enjoy Philosophy together. He had been sent
by the king, who desired Chonuphis, if he could make anything
out of the inscription, to interpret and return it quickly. After
spending three days in retirement, reading up characters from
all countries in ancient books, he wrote his answer to the king. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>579<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He explained to us that this inscription directs the holding of
a competition in honour of the Muses. The characters belonged
to the system of the reign of Proteus, the one learnt by Hercules
the son of Amphitryon. The God therein directs and charges
the Greeks to observe a time of peace and leisure, spending it in
continuous philosophical debate, with the help of the Muses
and of Reason, for the decision of points relating to Justice, all
arms being laid aside. We thought at the time that what
Chonuphis said was good, and we thought so still more when, in
our journey from Egypt round Caria, we met certain Delians <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>who begged Plato, as a geometrician, to solve the problem propounded
in a mysterious oracle of the God. The oracle was
this: “The Delians and the other Greeks shall have respite
from their present ills when they have doubled the altar at
Delos.” The Delians were unable to guess the meaning, and,
moreover, had brought themselves into a ludicrous difficulty
about the construction of the altar. They had doubled each of
the four sides,<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c006'><sup>[28]</sup></a> and so unconsciously produced a solid figure
eight times greater than the original, in ignorance of the factor
which must be applied to the side, in order to double the solid.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> So they appealed to Plato for help in the difficulty. Plato,
remembering the Egyptian, said that the God was rallying the
Greeks on their neglect of liberal studies, mocking our ignorance,
and commanding us to take up geometry in real earnest; that
it required no slight or dim-sighted intellect, but a first-rate
training in linear geometry, to find two mean proportionals, the
only method by which a solid in the form of a cube can be
doubled, if all its dimensions are to be increased uniformly.
Eudoxus of Cnidos, he said, or Helicon of Cyzicus, would work
this out for them.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c006'><sup>[29]</sup></a> However, in his opinion, the God did not
desire this; he was enjoining all the Greeks to cease from war
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> and trouble and devote themselves to the Muses, to soften their
passions by discussions and Mathematics, and to associate profitably
with one another.’</p>

<p class='c005'>VIII. While Simmias was speaking, our father Polymnis
came in upon us. He sat down by Simmias and said: ‘Epaminondas
invites you and all present, if you have no more pressing
engagement, to wait hereabouts; he wants to introduce to you
the stranger, a man noble himself, and brought here by a noble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>and generous errand. He comes from the Pythagoreans of <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Italy, to pour offerings on the tomb of old Lysis, in accordance,
as he says, with certain dreams and clear visions. He brings
a large sum in gold, thinking that Epaminondas ought to be
reimbursed for the care of Lysis in his old age, and on this he
insists most keenly, though we neither ask nor wish assistance
for our poverty.’ Simmias was pleased: ‘A really wonderful
man,’ he said, ‘and worthy of Philosophy; but what is the
reason that he has not come straight to us?’ ‘He passed the
night, I think,’ said he, ‘near the tomb of Lysis; Epaminondas <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
was to take him on to the Ismenus to bathe, and then they will
come on to us here. Before he met us, he had made his night’s
lodging near the tomb, intending to take up the remains and
convey them to Italy, unless prevented by some divine warning
in the night.’ Having said this, my father was silent.</p>

<p class='c005'>IX. Then Galaxidorus spoke: ‘Hercules! how hard it is
to find a man quite free from vanity and superstition! Some
are caught by these weaknesses against their will, owing to want
of experience or of strength. Others, in order to appear singular
and to be taken for friends of the Gods, bring the divine into
all they do, making dreams and portents and such stuff a pretext
for anything that enters their head. Now, to men in public <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>580<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
stations, who are compelled to adapt their lives to a self-willed
and petulant multitude, this may have its advantage; superstition
is a bit wherewith to check a populace, and direct it to
what is expedient. But to Philosophy such posturing is unbecoming
in itself, and, moreover, it contradicts her professions;
she undertakes to teach all that is good and expedient by the
reason, and then, as though in despite of reason, goes back upon
the Gods and away from the first principles of action; and,
dishonouring demonstration, in which her own excellence is
supposed to lie, turns to prophecies and visions seen in dreams, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
things in which the weakest often have as great success as the
strongest. This, I think, Simmias, is why your Socrates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>embraced a system of intellectual training which bore a more
philosophical stamp, choosing that simple artless type as being
liberal and most friendly to truth; and casting to the winds
for the sophists, as a mere smoke from Philosophy, all pretentious
nonsense.’ Theocritus broke in: ‘What, Galaxidorus, and
has Meletus persuaded even you too that Socrates despised
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> what was divine, for that was the charge which he actually
brought before the Athenians?’ ‘What was divine—no;’
he said, ‘but he received Philosophy from Pythagoras and
Empedocles full of visions and myths and superstitions, and
deeply dipped in mysteries; and trained her to look at facts,
and be sensible, and pursue truth in soberness of reason.’</p>

<p class='c005'>X. ‘Granted;’ said Theocritus, ‘but as to the Divine
Sign of Socrates, good friend, are we to call it a falsity or
what? To me, nothing recorded about Pythagoras seems to
go so far towards the prophetic and divine. For, in plain words,
as Homer has drawn Athena to Odysseus</p>

<p class='c011'>even so, apparently, did the spirit attach to Socrates, from the

<p class='c011'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> in matters of uncertainty, too hard for the wit of man to solve;
upon these the spirit used often to converse with him, adding
a divine touch to his own resolutions. For more, and more
important, instances you must ask Simmias and the other
companions of Socrates. But I was myself present, having
come to stay with Euthyphron the prophet, when Socrates, as
you remember, Simmias, was going up to the Symbolum and
the house of Andocides, asking some question as he walked and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>playfully cross-examining Euthyphron. Suddenly he stopped
and closed his lips tightly<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c006'><sup>[32]</sup></a> and was wrapt in thought for some
time. Then he turned back and took the way through the <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Trunkmakers’ Street, and tried to recall those of our friends
who were already in advance, saying that the Sign was upon him.
Most of them turned in a body, amongst whom was I, keeping
close to Euthyphron. But some young members of the party, no
doubt to put the Sign of Socrates to the test, held on, and drew
into their number Charillus the flute-player, who had come
to Athens with myself, staying with Cebes. Now as they were
going through the street of the Statuaries near the Law Courts,
they were met by a whole herd of swine loaded with mud and
hustling one another by press of numbers. There was no <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
getting out of the way; on they charged, upsetting some,
bespattering others. At any rate, Charillus came home with
his clothes full of mud and his legs too, so that we always laugh
when we remember Socrates and his Sign, and wonder that this
divine presence of his should never fail him or forget.’</p>

<p class='c005'>XI. Then Galaxidorus said: ‘Do you think then, Theocritus,
that the Sign of Socrates possessed a special and extraordinary
power, not that some fragment of the ready wit
which we all share determined him by an empiric process,
turning the scale of his reasoning in cases which were uncertain
and incalculable? For as a single weight does not by
itself incline the balance, but, if added to one scale when the
weights are even, sinks the whole of that one on its own side, so <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>581<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
a cry, or any such feather-weight sign, will fit<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c006'><sup>[33]</sup></a> a mind already
weighted, and draw it into action; and when two trains of
thought are in conflict, it reinforces one, and solves the difficulty
by removing the equality, so that there is a movement and an inclination.’
My father broke in: ‘Well, but I have myself heard,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Galaxidorus, from a certain Megarian, who had it from Terpsion,
that the Sign of Socrates was a sneeze, proceeding either from
himself or from other persons; if some one else sneezed on his
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> right, whether behind or in front, it encouraged him to the
action; if on the left, it warned him off it. Of his own sneezings
there was one kind which confirmed his purpose when he was
still intending to act; another stopped him when he was already
acting and checked his impulse. The wonder to me is that if
he made use of a sneeze he did not so call it to his companions,
but was in the habit of saying that what checked or commanded
him was a Divine Sign. For that would be like vanity and idle
boasting, not like truth and simplicity, in which lay, as we
suppose, his greatness and his superiority to men in general, to
be disturbed by a sound from outside or a casual sneeze, and so
be diverted from acting, and give up what he had resolved.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Now the impulses of Socrates, on the other hand, show firmness
and intensity in every direction, as though issuing from a right
and powerful judgement and principle. Thus for a man to
remain in voluntary poverty all his life, when he might have had
plenty, and the givers would have been pleased and thankful,
and never to swerve from Philosophy in the face of all those
hindrances; and at last, when the zeal and ingenuity of his
friends had made his way easy to safety and retreat, not to be
bent by their entreaties, nor yield to the near approach of
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> death—all this is not like a man whose judgement might be
changed by random voices or sneezings; it is like one led to
what is noble by some greater and more sovereign authority.
I hear also that he foretold to some of his friends the disaster
which befell the power of Athens in Sicily. At a still earlier
time, Pyrilampes, the son of Antiphon, when taken prisoner in
the pursuit near Delium, after having received from us a javelin
wound, as soon as he had heard from those who had arrived from
Athens to arrange the truce that Socrates had returned home
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>in safety by The Gullies<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c006'><sup>[34]</sup></a> with Alcibiades and Laches, often
called upon him by name, and often on friends and comrades of <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
his own who had fled with him by way of Parnes, and been slain
by our cavalry; they had disobeyed the Sign of Socrates, he
said, in turning from the battle by a different way instead of
following his lead. This, I think, Simmias too must have heard.’
‘Often,’ said Simmias, ‘and from many persons. For there
was no little noise at Athens about the Sign of Socrates in
consequence.’</p>

<p class='c005'>XII. ‘Well, then, Simmias,’ said Pheidolaus, ‘are we to
allow Galaxidorus in his jesting way to bring down this great
fact of divination to sneezings and cries, which plenty of common <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
ignorant persons apply to trifles in mere sport, whereas, when
grave dangers overtake them, or more serious business, we may
quote Euripides:<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c006'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>These follies have a truce when steel is near</i>‘?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Galaxidorus said: ‘I am quite ready to listen to Simmias on
this subject, Pheidolaus, if he has himself heard Socrates speak
about it, and to join you in believing; but as for all that you
and Polymnis have mentioned, it is not hard to refute it. For
as in medicine a throb or a pimple is a small matter, but is the
indication of what is not small; and as to a pilot the cry of
a bird from the open sea, or the scudding of a thin film of cloud, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>582<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
signifies wind and rougher seas, so to a prophetic soul a sneeze or
a voice is nothing great in itself, but is the sign of a great conjuncture.
There is no art in which it is thought contemptible
to forecast great things by small, many things through few.
Suppose a man ignorant of the meaning of letters were to see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>a few insignificant-looking characters, and to refuse to believe
that one who knew grammar could, by their help, repeat the
story of great wars between old-world peoples, and foundings
of cities, and what kings did or suffered, and then were to say
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> that a voice, or something like a voice, revealed and repeated
each of these things to that historian, a pleasant laugh would
come over your face, my friend, at the ignorance of that man.
Now, consider, may it not be so with us? In our ignorance of
the meaning of different things by which the prophetic art hits
the coming event, are we simple enough to rebel if a man of
intellect uses them to reveal something not yet evident, and
says, moreover, that a Divine Sign, not a sneeze or a voice,
directs him to the facts? For now I turn to you, Polymnis, who
wonder that Socrates, a man who did so very much to make
Philosophy human by simplicity and absence of cant, should
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> have named his Sign, not a sneeze or a voice, but, in full tragic
phrase, his Divine Sign. I, on the contrary, should be surprised
if a man so excellent in Dialectic and mastery of terms
had said that the sneeze and not the Divine Sign gave him the
intimation. As if a man were to say that he had been wounded
“by the javelin”, not “by the thrower with his javelin”, or,
again, that the weight had been measured “by the balance”,
not “by the weigher with his balance”. For the work is not
the work of the tool but of the owner of the tool which he
uses for the work; and the Sign is a kind of tool used by the
signifying power. But, as I said, if Simmias should have anything
to tell us we must listen, for his knowledge is more exact.’</p>

<p class='c005'>XIII. Then Theocritus said: ‘Yes, but first let us see
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> who these persons are who are coming in; or, rather, it is
surely Epaminondas bringing the stranger to us.’ We looked
towards the doors, and saw Epaminondas leading the way, then
Ismenidorus, Bacchylidas, and Melissus the flute-player, all of
them our friends and confederates; then the stranger followed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>a man of much nobility of mien, but with a gentle and kindly
character apparent beneath it, and dressed in a grave fashion.
He took his seat by Simmias, my brother next to me, and the
rest as they found places. Then, when there was silence,
Simmias called on my brother: ‘Well, Epaminondas, how
are we to address our friend? Who and what is he, and <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
whence? That is the usual formula for beginning an
introduction and an acquaintance.’<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c006'><sup>[36]</sup></a> Epaminondas replied:
‘Theanor is his name, Simmias, and his family is of Crotona,
where he belongs to the local school of Philosophy and does no
discredit to the great fame of Pythagoras; he has just taken the
long journey from Italy here, to confirm noble doctrines by
noble acts.’ The stranger broke in: ‘Indeed, Epaminondas,
you are now hindering the noblest of all actions. For if to
confer a benefit on friends be noble, it is no shame to receive <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
one from them. A favour needs one to receive, no less than
one to bestow it; both must join to ensure a noble result. It
is like a ball well delivered; to allow it to drop idle to the
ground is to shame it. Now what mark is there for a ball, so
agreeable for the thrower to hit and so distressing to miss, as
a man at whom one aims a favour when he well deserves it?
But in the one case the mark stands still, and he who misses has
himself to thank; in the other, he who excuses himself and
swerves aside does a wrong to the favour which never reaches
its goal. You have yourself heard fully from me the reasons
of my voyage here; but I should like to go through the story <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>583<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
as fully to those now present, and let them be judges between us.</p>

<p class='c005'>‘When the Pythagoreans had been overpowered by faction
in the different cities, and their brotherhoods expelled, and
when the party of Cylon had piled up a fire round a house in
Metapontum in which those still settled there were holding
a meeting, and had dispatched all those in the place except
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Philolaus and Lysis, who were still young, and were strong
enough and active enough to push through the fire, Philolaus
escaped thence to Lucania and joined in safety the rest of our
friends, who were by this time rallying and holding their own
against the Cylonians. Where Lysis was, no one knew for
a long time; however, Gorgias of Leontini, sailing back from
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Greece to Sicily, brought certain news to Arcesus and his
friends that he had met Lysis, who was staying near Thebes.
Arcesus longed to see the man, and was eager to sail straight off
himself; but being quite disabled by age and infirmity, gave
orders to bring Lysis alive to Italy if possible, or his remains if
he should have died. Then came wars, revolutions, and
periods of tyranny which made it impossible for the friends to
perform the task in his lifetime. But when the spirit of Lysis,
now dead, had shown us clearly of his end, and well informed
persons told us of all the care and entertainment which he had
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> received from your family, Polymnis; how richly his age had
been cared for in a poor house, and how he had been adopted
as father to your sons before his blessed end came, I was sent
out, a young man and alone, to represent many of my elders
who have money and wish to offer it to those who have not, in
return for favour and friendship richly bestowed. Lysis lies
where you have honourably laid him; yet the honour of that
tomb is greater when recompense is made for it to friends by
friends dear and close.’</p>

<p class='c005'>XIV. While the stranger was speaking thus, my father
wept a long while over the memory of Lysis, but my brother
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> with his usual gentle smile said to me: ‘What is it to be,
Capheisias? Are we to surrender poverty to riches, and to say
nothing?’ ‘No! no!’ said I, ‘the dear “good nurse of
young manhood”<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c006'><sup>[37]</sup></a>—to her rescue! it is your turn to speak.’
‘See, father;’ he said, ‘that was the only side on which
I used to fear that our house might be captured by money.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>I mean through Capheisias and his person, which needs beautiful
clothes that he may make a brave show before all his admiring
friends, and needs food of the best, and plenty of it, that he
may have strength for the gymnasia and wrestling matches.
Now that he does not betray poverty, or throw off our ancestral
poverty like a coat of paint, but, boy though he is, goes proudly <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
in thrift, and is content with what we have, to what possible
use could we put money? Shall we plate our armour, say, with
gold, and make the shield gay with purple and gold together,
as Nicias of Athens did?<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c006'><sup>[38]</sup></a> Shall we buy you, father, a Milesian
cloak, or a dress with a purple border for mother? You know,
we are not likely to spend the present on our table, or to feast
ourselves more sumptuously, as having admitted a guest of
such importance as wealth.’ ‘Away with it, boy!’ said my
father, ‘never may I see our life new-modelled like that!’ <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘No,’ my brother went on, ‘nor will we sit idle at home and
guard our wealth; that would be a “boonless boon”<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c006'><sup>[39]</sup></a> indeed,
and a getting with no honour to it.’ ‘Of course’, said our
father. ‘You know,’ Epaminondas went on, ‘when Jason, the
Thessalian Tagus, lately sent a large sum of money here to us
and begged us to take it, he thought me something of a boor
when I answered that he was making the first move in wrong
and robbery, when a lover of monarchy like himself tempted
with money a private citizen of a free self-governed state.
From you, Sir, I accept your generous intention, and admire it <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>584<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
more than I can say; it is beautiful and philosophical too; but
you are bringing medicines to friends who are not sick! Suppose
that you had heard that we were attacked in war, and had
sailed with arms and ammunition to help us, and on arrival had
found that all was friendliness and peace; you would not think
it necessary to hand over the stores and leave them where they
were not needed. Even so, you have come to be our ally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>against poverty, thinking that we were pinched by her, but
there is none so easy to be endured as she, our dear fellow-lodger.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> So no need for money or arms against her who vexes us not.
Take back this message to your brotherhood: that they themselves
use their wealth most nobly, but that there are friends here
who make noble use of poverty: and that, as to the entertainment
of Lysis and his burial, Lysis has paid the score in
full for himself, not least by teaching us not to fret at poverty.’</p>

<p class='c005'>XV. Theanor broke in: ‘Then, if it is ignoble to fret at
poverty, is it not eccentric to fear and shun wealth?’ ‘Eccentric
it is if it is rejected on no rational grounds, but in order
to pose or because of insipid taste or affectation of some kind.’
‘But what rational grounds’, he said, ‘could bar the getting
of wealth by good and honest means, Epaminondas? Or rather—and
surrender more gently than you did to the Thessalian in
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> answering our questions about these matters—tell me whether
you think that the giving of money may sometimes be right,
but the receiving never; or that givers and receivers alike are
in all cases wrong?’ ‘No, no!’ said Epaminondas, ‘I hold
that, as with everything else, so with wealth; there is a giving
and a getting which are ugly, and a giving and a getting which
are fine.’ ‘Then,’ said Theanor, ‘when a man gives readily
and heartily what he owes, is not that beautiful?’ He assented.
‘But when one receives what another beautifully gives, is not
the taking beautiful? Or could there be a fairer taking of
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> money than when it comes from one who gives fairly?’ ‘There
could not’, he said. ‘Then of two friends, Epaminondas,’
said he, ‘if one is to give, it looks as if the other must take. For
in battles one must swerve away from a marksman in the
enemy’s ranks; in the conflict of benefits it is not fair to avoid
or thrust aside the friend who nobly gives. For, if poverty is
no affliction, yet wealth, on its side, is not a thing to be flouted
and refused like that.’ ‘It is not,’ said Epaminondas, ‘but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>there is a case where the gift which may be nobly offered remains
more honoured and more noble if it is refused. Look at it with
us in this way: you will allow that there are many desires, and
desires of many things; some inborn, as we call them, which
grow up about the body and are directed towards its necessary
pleasures; others adventitious, grounded on mere fancies, but <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
gaining strength and power by time and use, where there is
vicious education, and often dragging down the soul more
forcibly than do those which are necessary. Now, by habits
and training, men have before now succeeded in drawing off and
subjecting to reason, in great measure, the innate affections.
But the whole force of discipline, my friend, must be brought
to bear against those which are adventitious and extraordinary;
we must work them out, and hack them off, and use restraints
and checks to school them to reason. For if thirst and hunger
are forced out by rational resistance in the matter of food and <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
drink, far easier surely is it to stunt, and in the end to annihilate,
love of wealth and love of glory by refusing and prohibiting the
things at which they aim. Do you not agree?’ The stranger
assented. ‘Then, do you see a distinction’, Epaminondas
went on, ‘between training and the intended result of the
training? Thus the result of athletic exercise would be the
contest against a competitor for the crown; training would be
the preparation of the body for this contest of the gymnasia.
So with virtue, do you allow that there are two things, the result
and the training?’ The stranger assented. ‘Now then,’
Epaminondas resumed, ‘tell me first with respect to temperance;
do you take abstinence from base and lawless pleasures <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>585<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
to be a training, or rather a result and a proof of training?’
‘A result and a proof’, he said. ‘But it is a training or study
in temperance—is it not?—which still draws all of you on when
you go to the gymnasia and have stirred up your desires for
food, as though they were wild beasts, and then stand for a long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>time over bright tables with a variety of dishes, and at last pass
the good cheer for your servants to enjoy, offering to your own
now chastened appetites only what is plain and simple, since
abstinence from pleasures in things allowed is a training for the
soul against pleasures which are forbidden?’ ‘No doubt’, he
said. ‘Then there is, friend, a way of training ourselves for
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> justice against the love of wealth and money; I do not mean
never to enter our neighbour’s premises by night and steal his
goods, and never to take his clothes at the bath; nor yet if
a man does not betray country and friends for money is he
training himself against covetousness (since here, perhaps, the
law comes in and fear, to hinder greediness from doing acts of
wrong). No, the man who often and voluntarily sets himself
aloof from gains which are just and are allowed by law is training
and habituating himself in advance to keep his distance from
every gain which is unrighteous and forbidden. For as, when
it encounters great pleasures which are also strange and hurtful,
the mind cannot avoid a flutter unless it has often despised
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> permitted enjoyments, so to pass by vicious gains and great
advancement when they come within reach is not easy, unless
from a great way off the love of gain has been fettered and
chastened; whereas, if it has been brought up to gain, and
there has been no check on its license, it makes a riotous growth
towards all iniquity, and only with the greatest effort is it
withheld from grasping an advantage. But if a man does not
surrender himself to the favours of friends or to the bounties of
kings, but has said no even to an inheritance which Fortune
offers, and has put far off that love of wealth which springs up
to meet a treasure as it comes into sight, he finds that covetousness
rises up against him no longer, nor tempts him to what is
wrong, nor disturbs his understanding. He is gentle, and
possesses himself for noble uses; he has great thoughts and
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> shares with his soul the noblest secrets. We, Capheisias and I,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>are lovers of such men, dear Simmias, and we entreat the
stranger to allow us so to train ourselves in poverty that we may
reach virtue such as that.’</p>

<p class='c005'>XVI. My brother finished his argument, and then Simmias
nodded his head two or three times. ‘A great man,’ he said,
‘a great man is Epaminondas, and thanks to Polymnis here for
that, who procured for his sons from the first the best training
in Philosophy. However, with regard to this question, Sir, do
you and they settle it between you. Now about Lysis, if we <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
may be allowed to hear. Do you mean to move him from his
tomb and to transfer him to Italy; or will you allow him to
remain here with us, where he shall find kind and friendly
fellow-lodgers when our time comes?’ Theanor smiled on
him: ‘Lysis appears, Simmias, to love this country, in which
by the good offices of Epaminondas he has wanted nothing that
is honourable. For there is a certain holy rite connected with
our Pythagorean burials, which if we lack we do not seem to
attain our full and blessed consummation. So when we knew
from dreams of the death of Lysis (we distinguish by a certain
sign which is revealed in sleep whether an appearance belongs <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
to a dead person or a living), this thought came over many of
us: so Lysis has been buried in another land with strange rites;
he must be moved here to us, that he may share in all that is
customary. Coming with such an intention, and guided
straight to the tomb by people of the place, I was pouring
libations just at evening time, and calling on the soul of Lysis
to return and declare solemnly how we ought to act. The night
went on and I saw nothing, but thought I heard a voice: “Stir
not what is best unstirred; the body of Lysis has been buried
with holy rites by friends; his soul has already been parted
from it and dismissed to another birth, with another spirit for
its partner.” Accordingly, when I met Epaminondas at dawn <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>586<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and heard the manner in which he buried Lysis, I recognized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>that he had been well trained by that great teacher, even
to the rules which must not be spoken, and had enjoyed the
guidance in life from the same spirit as he, unless I fail to
guess the pilot aright from the course steered. For “wide are
the tracks”<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c006'><sup>[40]</sup></a> of our lives, and few there are of them by which
the spirits lead men.’ When Theanor had said this, he looked
closely at Epaminondas, as though scrutinizing him afresh
without and within.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> XVII. In the meantime the surgeon came up and loosened
Simmias’ bandage, intending to dress the limb. But Phyllidas
came in upon us with Hippostheneidas, and bidding me, and also
Charon and Theocritus, rise and follow him, led us to a corner
of the colonnade, his face showing great agitation. To my
question, ‘Any news, Phyllidas?’ he answered, ‘No news to
me; I knew and told you all the time how weak Hippostheneidas
was, and implored you not to admit him as an associate of our
enterprise.’ We were dismayed at this, and Hippostheneidas
said: ‘In Heaven’s name, Phyllidas, do not say that; do not
take rashness to be courage, and thereby ruin us and the city too;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> but allow the men to make their own return in safety if it is so
appointed.’ Phyllidas was nettled: ‘Tell me, Hippostheneidas,’
he said, ‘how many do you think share the inner secrets of
our plan?’ ‘Not less than thirty, to my knowledge’, he said.
‘Very well,’ said Phyllidas, ‘there is all that number, and you
have taken on your single self to annul and check the plan on
which all had resolved, you sent a mounted messenger to the
men when already on their road, bidding them turn back and
not press on to-day, when most of the arrangements for their
return have settled themselves without us.’ When Phyllidas
had said this we were all much disturbed, but Charon fastened
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> his eyes very severely on Hippostheneidas: ‘Villain!’ he said,
‘what have you done to us?’ ‘Nothing terrible,’ answered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Hippostheneidas, ‘if you will drop your harsh tone and listen
to the calculations of a man of your own age, with grey hairs
like yourself. If we have resolved to give our countrymen an
exhibition of a courage which loves danger, and a spirit which
makes little of life, then there is much of the day still before us,
Phyllidas; let us not wait for the evening, but march at once
against the tyrants, our swords in our hands—let us slay, let us
die, let us never spare ourselves! But say we find no difficulty
in this, whether of action or of endurance, yet to rescue Thebes <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
from an armed force, when encompassed by so many enemies,
and to expel the Spartan garrison at a cost of two or three lives,
is not easy; for Phyllidas has never prepared so much strong
liquor for his parties and receptions that all the fifteen hundred
men of Archias’ bodyguard will be made drunk; yet, even if we
get rid of him, Herippidas is on for night duty and sober, and
Arcesus too. This being so, why hurry to bring home friends
and relatives to manifest destruction, and that when the very
fact of their return is not unknown to the enemy? Or why have <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the Thespians been ordered to be under arms for these two days
past, and ready whenever the Spartan officers call? Again, I hear
that Amphitheus is to be examined and put to death to-day,
whenever Archias returns. Are not these strong signs that our
action is not unmarked? Is it not best to pause, not for a long
time, but long enough to make the auspices right? For the
prophets declare, that in sacrificing the ox to Demeter, they
found that the entrails prognosticated much commotion and
public danger. Again, and this needs the greatest caution on
your part, Charon, yesterday Hypatodorus son of Erianthes
walked back with me from the farm, quite a good and friendly <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>587<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
person, but certainly not in our secrets. “Charon is your friend,
Hippostheneidas,” he said, “but I do not know him well; tell
him, if you think good, to be on his guard against a certain
danger revealed in a very strange and disagreeable dream.
Last night I thought that his house was in pangs as of labour,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>and that he and the friends who shared his anxiety prayed and
stood around it, while it moaned and uttered inarticulate
sounds. At last the fire flared out strong and terrible from
within, so that most of the city was caught by the blaze, but
the Cadmeia was only wrapped in smoke, the fire not spreading
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> up to it.” The vision which the man described was something
like this, Charon; I was alarmed at the time, and much more
so when I heard to-day that the exiles are to be put up at your
house; I am now in an agony lest we may be bringing a load
of troubles upon ourselves, yet not doing any harm worth
mentioning to the enemies, but simply stirring them up. For
I reckon the city to be on our side, the Cadmeia with them,
as it certainly is.’</p>

<p class='c005'>XVIII. Theocritus broke in, stopping Charon who wanted
to say something to Hippostheneidas: ‘Well, Hippostheneidas,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> nothing has ever struck me as so encouraging for action (although
I have myself always found my sacrifices favourable for the
exiles), as this vision; strong, clear light over the city, rising,
you tell us, out of a friendly house; the head-quarters of our
enemies wrapped in black smoke, which always imports, at the
best, tears and confusion; then inarticulate utterances proceeding
from our side, so that, even if any one were to attempt to
inform against us, only an indistinct rumour and blind suspicion
can attach to our enterprise, which will have succeeded by the
time it is evident. That the priests should find sacrifices unfavourable
is natural; officials and victim belong to those in
power, not to the people.’ While Theocritus was still speaking,
I turned to Hippostheneidas: ‘What messenger did you send
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> out to them? Unless you have allowed a very long start we will
give chase.’ ‘I do not know,’ he said, ‘for I must tell you the
truth, Capheisias, whether you could possibly overtake the
man; he has the best horse in Thebes. The man is known to
you; he is head groom in Melon’s chariot stables, and through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Melon knows our enterprise from its beginning.’ Meanwhile
I had espied the man, and said, ‘Hippostheneidas, do you not
mean Chlidon, who won the single-horse race in last year’s
Heraea?’ ‘That is the man’, he said. ‘And who is that,’
I said, ‘standing this long time at the outer gates, and looking
in at us?’ Then Hippostheneidas turned: ‘Chlidon,’ he <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
said, ‘yes, by Hercules, I fear something has gone very wrong.’
Meanwhile, the man saw that we were observing him, and drew
up quietly from the door. Hippostheneidas gave him a nod
and bade him speak out to all present. ‘I know these gentlemen,
Hippostheneidas, perfectly well; and finding you neither
at home nor in the market-place, I guessed that you had come to
them, so I took the shortest way here, that you may all know <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
everything which has happened. When you ordered me to
use all speed and meet the party in the hill country, I went home
to get my horse; but when I asked for the bridle, my wife
could not give it me, but stayed a long time in the store room.
She searched and turned out everything inside, and after fooling
me to her heart’s content, at last confessed that she had lent the
bridle to our neighbour the evening before, his wife having come
in to ask for one. I was angry and used strong words to her,
upon which she took to horrible imprecations—“A bad journey <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>588<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and a bad return to you all!” May Heaven throw it all back
upon herself, by Zeus, yes! At last, in my anger, I got as far as
blows; then a crowd of neighbours and women ran up; I have
behaved shamefully and have been treated no better, and have
just managed to make my way to you, that you may send some
one else to the exiles, for I am fairly off my head by this time
and feel badly upset.’</p>

<p class='c005'>XIX. We now experienced a strange revulsion of feeling.
A little before we were chafing at the check we had received;
now that the crisis was upon us short and sharp, and no delay
possible, we found ourselves passing into an anguish of alarm.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>However, I said a word of greeting and encouragement to
Hippostheneidas, to the effect that the very Gods were calling us
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> on to action. After this Phyllidas went out to arrange for his
party, and to get Archias plunged straight into his drink, Charon
to see to his house, while Theocritus and I returned to Simmias
on the chance of getting a word with Epaminondas.</p>

<p class='c005'>XX. However, they were far on in an inquiry of no mean
import, Heaven knows, but one which Galaxidorus and Pheidolaus
had started a little earlier, the problem of the real nature
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> and potency of the Divine Sign of Socrates, so called. What
Simmias said in reply to the argument of Galaxidorus we did
not hear; but he went on to say that he had himself once asked
Socrates on the subject, and failed to get an answer, and so
had never asked again; but that he had often been with him
when he gave his opinion that those who claim intercourse with
the divine by way of vision are impostors, whereas he attended
to those who professed to hear a voice, and put serious questions
to them. Hence it began to occur to us, as we were discussing
the matter among ourselves, to suspect that the Divine Sign of
Socrates might possibly be no vision but a special sense for
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> sounds or words, with which he had contact in some strange
manner; just as in sleep there is no voice heard, but fancies
and notions as to particular words reach the sleepers, who then
think that they hear people talking. Only sleepers receive such
conceptions in a real dream because of the tranquillity and calm
of the body in sleep, whereas in waking moments the soul can
hardly attend to greater powers, being so choked by thronging
emotions and distracting needs that they are unable to listen
and to give their attention to clear revelations. But the mind
of Socrates, pure and passionless, and intermingling itself but
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> little with the body for necessary purposes, was fine and light of
touch, and quickly changed under any impression. The impression
we may conjecture to have been no voice, but the utterance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>of a spirit, which without vocal sound reached the perceiving
mind by the revelation itself. For voice is like a blow upon
the soul, which perforce admits its utterance by way of the
ears, whenever we converse with one another. But the mind
of a stronger being leads the gifted soul, touching it with the
thing thought, and no blow is needed. To such a being soul
yields as it relaxes or tightens the impulses, which are never <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
violent, as when there are passions to resist, but supple and pliant
like reins which give. There is nothing wonderful in this;
as we see great cargo-vessels turned about by little helms, and,
again, potters’ wheels whirling round in even revolution at the
light touch of a hand. These are things without a soul no doubt,
yet so constructed as to run swiftly and smoothly, and therefore
to yield to a motive force when a touch is given. But the soul
of a man, being strained by countless impulses, as by cords, is
far the easiest of all machines to turn, if it be touched rationally;
it accepts the touch of thought, and moves as thought directs.
For here the passions and impulses are stretched towards the <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>589<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
thinking principle and end in it; if that principle be stirred they
receive a pull, and in turn draw and strain the man. And thus
we are allowed to learn how great is the power of a thought.
For bones, which have no sensation, and nerves and fleshy parts
charged with humours, and the whole resultant mass in its
ponderous quiescence, do yet, as soon as the soul sets something
a going in thought and directs its impulse towards it, rise up,
alert and tense, a whole which moves to action in all its
members, as though it had wings. But it is hard, nay, perhaps,
altogether beyond our powers, to take in at one glance the <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
system of excitation, complex strain, and divine prompting,
whereby the soul, after conceiving a thought, draws on the
mass of the body by the impulses which it gives.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c006'><sup>[41]</sup></a> Yet whereas
a word thus intellectually apprehended excites the soul, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>no sort of voice is heard and no action takes place, even so we
need not, I think, find it hard to believe that mind may be led
by a stronger mind and a more divine soul external to itself,
having contact with it after its kind, as word with word or light
with reflection. For in actual fact we recognize the thoughts
of one another by groping as it were in darkness with the assistance
of voice; whereas the thoughts of spirits have light, they
shine upon men capable of receiving them, they need not verbs
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> or nouns, those symbols whereby men in their intercourse with
men see resemblances and images of the things thought, yet
never apprehend the things themselves, save only those upon
whom, as we have said, there shines from within a peculiar and
spiritual light. And yet what we see happen in the case of the
voice may partly reassure the incredulous. The air is impressed
with articulate sounds, it becomes all word and voice, and brings
the meaning home to the soul of the hearer. Therefore we need
not wonder if, in regard to this special mode of thought also,
the air is sensitive to the touch of higher beings, and is so modified
as to convey to the mind of godlike and extraordinary men
the thought of him who thought it. For as the strokes of
miners<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c006'><sup>[42]</sup></a> are caught on brazen shields because of the reverberation,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> when they rise from below ground and fall upon them,
whereas falling on any other surface they are indistinct and pass
to nothing, even so the words of spirits pass through all Nature,
but only sound for those who possess the soul in untroubled
calm, holy and spiritual men as we emphatically call them.
The view of most people is that spiritual visitations come to
men in sleep; that they should be similarly stirred when awake
and in their full faculties they think marvellous and beyond
belief. As though a musician were thought to use his lyre
when the strings are let down, and not to touch or use it when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>it is strung up and tuned! They do not see the cause, their <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
own inner tunelessness and discord, from which Socrates our
friend had been set free, as the oracle given to his father when he
was yet a boy declared. For it bade him allow his son to do whatever
came into his mind; not to force nor direct his goings, but
to let his impulse have free play, only to pray for him to Zeus
Agoraios and to the Muses, but for all else not to meddle with
Socrates; meaning no doubt that he had within him a guide for <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
his life who was better than ten thousand teachers and directors.</p>

<p class='c005'>XXI. This, Pheidolaus, is what has occurred to me to
think about the Divine Sign of Socrates, in his lifetime and
since his death, dismissing with contempt those who have
suggested voices or sneezings or anything of that sort. But
what I have heard Timarchus of Chaeroneia relate on this head
it may perhaps be better to pass over in silence, as more like
myth than history. ‘Not at all;’ said Theocritus, ‘let us
have it all. Even myth touches truth, not too closely, perhaps,
but it does touch it at points. But first, who was this Timarchus?
Explain, for I do not know him.’ ‘Naturally, Theocritus,’ <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>590<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
said Simmias, ‘for he died quite young, having begged
that he might be buried near Lamprocles, the son of Socrates,
who had died a few days before, his own friend and
contemporary. He then greatly wished to know what was
really meant by the Divine Sign of Socrates, and so, like a
generous youth fresh to the taste of Philosophy, having taken
no one but Cebes and myself into his plan, went down into
the cave of Trophonius, after performing the usual rites of the
oracle. Two nights and one day he remained below; and when
most people had given him up, and his family was mourning for <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
him, at early dawn he came up very radiant. He knelt to the
God, then made his way at once through the crowd, and related
to us many wonderful things which he had seen and heard.</p>

<p class='c005'>XXII. ‘He said that, when he descended into the oracular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>chamber, he first found himself in a great darkness; then, after
a prayer, lay a long while not very clearly conscious whether he
was awake or dreaming; only he fancied that his head received
a blow, while a dull noise fell on his ears, and then the sutures
parted and allowed his soul to issue forth. As it passed upwards,
rejoicing to mingle with the pure transparent air, it appeared
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> first to draw a long deep breath, after its narrow compression,
and to become larger than before, like a sail as it is filled out.
Then he heard dimly a whirring noise overhead out of which
came a sweet voice. He looked up and saw land nowhere, only
islands shining with lambent fire, from time to time changing
colour with one another, as though it were a coat of dye, while
the light became spangled in the transition. They appeared
to be countless in number and in size enormous, not all equal
but all alike circular. He thought that as these moved around
there was an answering hum of the air, for the gentleness of
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> that voice which was harmonized out of all corresponded to the
smoothness of the motion. Through the midst of the islands
a sea or lake was interfused, all shining with the colours as they
were commingled over its grey surface. Some few islands
floated in a straight course and were conveyed across the current;
many others were drawn on by the flood, being almost submerged.
The sea was of great depth in some parts towards the south,
but [northwards<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c006'><sup>[43]</sup></a>] there were very shallow reaches, and it often
swept over places and then left them dry, having no strong
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> ebb. The colour was in places pure as that of the open sea,
in others turbid and marsh-like. As the islands passed through
the surf they never came round to their starting-point again or
described a circle, but slightly varied the points of impact, thus
describing a continuous spiral as they went round. The sea
was inclined to the approximate middle and highest part of
the encompassing firmament by a little less than eight-ninths
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>of the whole, as it appeared to him. It had two openings which <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
received rivers of fire pouring in from opposite sides, so that it
was lashed into foam, and its grey surface was turned to white.
This he saw, delighted at the spectacle; but as he turned his
eyes downwards, there appeared a chasm, vast and round as
though hewn out of a sphere; it was strangely terrible and deep
and full of utter darkness, not in repose but often agitated and
surging up; from which were heard roarings innumerable and
groanings of beasts, and wailings of innumerable infants, and
with these mingled cries of men and women, dim sounds of all
sorts, and turmoils sent up indistinctly from the distant depth, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>591<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
to his no small consternation. Time passed, and an unseen
person said to him, “Timarchus, what do you wish to learn?”
“Everything,” he replied, “for all is wonderful.” “We”, the
voice said, “have little to do with the regions above, they belong
to other Gods; but the province of Persephone which we
administer, being one of the four which Styx bounds, you may
survey if you will.” To his question, “What is Styx?” “A
way to Hades,” was the reply, “and it passes right opposite,
parting the light at its very vertex, but reaching up, as you see,
from Hades below; where it touches the light in its revolution <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
it marks off the remotest region of all. Now, there are four
first principles of all things, the first of life, the second of
motion, the third of birth, the fourth of death. The first is
linked to the second by Unity, in the Unseen: the second to
the third by Mind, in the sun: the third to the fourth by
Nature, in the moon. Over each of these combinations a Fate,
daughter of Necessity, presides, and holds the keys; of the first
Atropus, of the second, Clotho, of the one belonging to the
moon Lachesis, and the turning-point of birth is there. For
the other islands contain Gods, but the moon, which belongs to <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
earthly spirits, only avoids Styx by a slight elevation, and is
caught once in one hundred and seventy-seven secondary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>measures<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c006'><sup>[44]</sup></a>. As Styx moves upon her, the souls cry aloud in
terror; for many slip from off her and are caught by Hades.
Others the moon bears upwards from below, as they turn towards
her; and for these death coincides with the moment of
birth, those excepted which are guilty and impure, and which
are not allowed to approach her while she lightens and bellows
fearfully; mourning for their own fate they slip away and are
borne downwards for another birth, as you see.” “But I see
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> nothing,” said Timarchus, “save many stars quivering around
the gulf, others sinking into it, others, again, darting up from
below.” “Then you see the spirits themselves,” the voice
said, “though you do not know it. It is thus: every soul
partakes of mind, there is none irrational or mindless; but so
much of soul as is mingled with flesh and with affections is
altered and turned towards the irrational by its sense of pleasures
and pains. But the mode of mingling is not the same for every
soul. Some are merged entirely into body, and are disturbed
by passions throughout their whole being during life. Others
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> are in part mixed up with it, but leave outside their purest part,
which is not drawn in, but is like a life-buoy which floats on
the surface, and touches the head of one who has sunk into the
depth, the soul clinging around it and being kept upright,
while so much of it is supported as obeys and is not overmastered
by the affections. The part which is borne below the surface
within the body is called soul. That which is left free from
dissolution most persons call mind, taking it to be something
inside themselves, resembling the reflected images in mirrors;
but those who are rightly informed know that it is outside
themselves and address it as spirit. The stars, Timarchus,”
the voice went on, “which you see extinguished, you are to
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> think of as souls entirely merged in bodies; those which give
light again and shine from below upwards, shaking off, as
though it were mud, a sort of gloom and dimness, are those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>which sail up again out of their bodies after death; those which
are parted upwards are spirits, and belong to men who are
said to have understanding. Try to see clearly in each the
bond by which it coheres with soul.” Hearing this, he paid
closer attention himself, and saw the stars tossing about, some
less, some more, as we see the corks which mark out nets in the
sea move over its surface; but some, like the shuttles used in <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>592<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
weaving, in entangled and irregular figures, not able to settle the
motion into a straight line. The voice said that those who kept
a straight and orderly movement were men whose souls had been
well broken in by fair nurture and training, and did not allow
their irrational part to be too harsh and rough. Those which
often inclined upwards and downwards in an irregular and
confused manner, like horses plunging off from a halter, were <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
fighting against the yoke with tempers disobedient and ill-trained
for want of education; sometimes getting the mastery
and swerving round to the right; again bent by passions and
drawn on to share in sins, then again resisting and putting force
upon them. The coupling bond, like a curb set on the irrational
part of the soul whenever it resists, brings on repentance, as we
call it, for sins, and shame for all lawless and intemperate
pleasures, being really a pain and a stroke inflicted by it on the
soul when it is bitted by that which masters and rules it, until at
length, being thus punished, it becomes obedient to the rein <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and familiar with it, and then, like a tame creature, without
blow or pain, understands the spirit quickly by signs and hints.
These then are led, late in the day and by slow degrees, to their
duty. Out of those who are docile and obedient to their spirit
from the first birth, is formed the prophetic and inspired class,
to which belonged the soul of Hermodorus<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c006'><sup>[45]</sup></a> of Clazomenae,
of which you have surely heard; how it would leave the body
entirely and wander over a wide range by night and by day, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> then come back again, having been present where many things
were said and done far off, until the enemy found the body,
which his wife had betrayed, left at home deserted by its soul,
and burnt it. Now this part is not true; the soul used not to
go out from the body; but by always yielding to the spirit,
and slackening the coupling-band, he gave it constant liberty
to range around, so that it saw and heard and reported many
things from the world outside. But those who destroyed the
body while he was asleep are paying the penalty in Tartarus unto
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> this day. All this, young man, you shall know more clearly in
the third month from this; now begone!” When the voice
ceased, Timarchus wished to turn round, he said, and see who
the speaker was; but his head again ached violently, as though
forcibly compressed, and he could no longer hear or perceive
anything passing about him; afterwards, however, he came to
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> by degrees, and saw that he was lying in the cave of Trophonius,
near the entrance where he had originally sunk down.</p>

<p class='c005'>XXIII. ‘Such was the tale of Timarchus. When he died,
having returned to Athens in the third month after hearing the
voice, and when, in our wonder, we told Socrates of the story,
he blamed us for not reporting it while Timarchus was still alive,
since he would gladly have heard it more clearly from himself,
and have questioned him further. There, Theocritus, you have
all, tale and theory both. But perhaps we ought to invite the
stranger to join our inquiry; the subject comes nearly home to inspired
men.’ ‘Well, but’, the stranger answered, ‘Epaminondas,
who puts out from the same port, is not contributing his opinion.’
Our father smiled: ‘That is just his character, Sir. Silent and
cautious in speaking, but a glutton for learning and listening.
That is why Spintharus of Tarentum, after spending no little time
with him here, is always saying, as you know, that he never met
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>593<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> any man of his own standing who knew more or who spoke less.
So pray let us have all your own thoughts on the subject.’</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>XXIV. ‘Then, for my part,’ said Theanor, ‘I think that the
story of Timarchus ought to be dedicated to the God, as holy and
inviolable. But it will be strange to me if any shall be found to
discredit what Simmias tells us about the matter; thus, while
they designate swans, serpents, dogs and horses as sacred, refusing
to believe that men may be godlike and friends of God, yet
holding that God is not a friend of birds but a friend of man.
As, then, a man who loves horses does not care equally for all
individuals which make the class, but always picks out and separates <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
some excellent member of the class, and trains him by himself
and feeds him and loves him beyond others; so it is with ourselves;
the higher powers extract, if the word may pass, the best out of
the herd, and deem them worthy of a very special training, directing
their course, not by reins nor by halters, but by reason, through
signs utterly incomprehensible to the general herd. Why, most
dogs do not understand the signals used in hunting, nor most
horses those used in the manège; but those who have learned know
at once from a whistle or a chirrup what they are required to do,
and easily take the right position. Homer clearly knows the distinction <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
to which I refer. Some of his prophets he calls “readers
of dreams” and “priests”, others understand the conversation
of the Gods themselves, he thinks, by sympathy, and signify the
future to us. For instance:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Thus they conferred: but Helenus, Priam’s son,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>That scheme, which pleased them, in his heart divined.</i><a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c006'><sup>[46]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>And again:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>So the everlasting voice I have heard and known.</i><a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c006'><sup>[47]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The mind of kings and generals is made known to outsiders through
the senses, by special beacons or proclamation, or calls on the
trumpet; and so the divine message reaches few of us in and <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
through itself, and that rarely; for ordinary men signals are employed
and these are the groundwork of what we call divination.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>The Gods, then, regulate life only for a few, for those whom they
wish to make blessed in a single degree, and truly divine;
but souls released from coming to the birth, and now for ever
at rest from a body, and dismissed into freedom, are spirits
who care for men, in Hesiod’s sense. For as athletes, when
age has brought them an end of training, do not wholly lose the
spirit of competition or of care for the body, but delight to see
others in practice, and cheer them on and run beside them, so
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> those who have ceased from the struggles of life, made spirits because
of the excellence of their soul, do not utterly despise our
earthly affairs, our discussions and our interests: they have a kindly
feeling for those training with the same end before them, they
share their eagerness for virtue, encourage them, and join them
in their bursts, whenever they see them running with hope near
at hand and already within touch. For the spirit does not help
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> all men as they come. It is as with swimmers upon the sea; spectators
on the shore merely gaze in silence on those who are out
in the open, drifting far from land; whereas they run along the
beach towards those who are already nearing it, they dash in to
meet them, and with hand, and voice, and endeavour, hasten to
the rescue. Such, Simmias, is the way of a spirit; while we are
dipped beneath the tides of life, changing body for body, like
relays on a road, he allows us to struggle out for ourselves, to
be brave and patient, to try by our own virtue to reach the
harbour in safety. But when any soul through a myriad of
births has striven once and again a long-drawn strife well and
stoutly, and when, with the cycle now wellnigh complete, it
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>594<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> takes the risks, and sets its hope high, as it nears the landing-place,
and presses upwards with sweat and endeavour, the God
thinks it no wrong that its own spirit should go to the help of
such a soul, but lets zeal go free, and the Gods are zealous to
encourage and to save, one this soul and one that. The soul
hearkens because it is so near, and it is saved; but if it does
not hearken the spirit leaves it, and its happy chance is gone.’</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>XXV. As he finished, Epaminondas looked at me. ‘It is
nearly your time, Capheisias, to go to the gymnasium and not
fail your comrades; we will take care of Theanor, and break up <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
our conference whenever he likes.’ ‘Let us do so,’ I said, ‘but
I think Theocritus here wants a few words with you while
Galaxidorus and I are present.’ ‘By all means’, said he; he
rose and led the way to the angle of the portico. We stood round
and tried to encourage him to join the scheme. He answered
that he perfectly well knew the day of the return of the exiles,
and had arranged with Gorgidas as to all that was necessary
for our friends, but that he refused to take the life of any
citizen without trial, unless there were an urgent necessity;
also, looking to the body of the Thebans, it was specially
convenient that there should be some person with hands clean <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and beyond suspicion, when the time should come to advise the
people for the best. We agreed, and he returned at once to
Simmias and his party. We went down to the gymnasium and
met our friends, and, pairing off for wrestling matches, exchanged
information and plans for action. We saw also Archias
and Philippus, anointed and starting for the supper. For Phyllidas, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
fearing that they might put Amphitheus to death first,
called on Archias immediately after he had escorted Lysanoridas,
and by suggesting hopes that the lady he desired to meet
would come to the place, persuaded him to turn his mind to
having a good time with the usual companions of his revels.</p>

<p class='c005'>XXVI. It was now getting late, and the cold was intense, as
the wind had got up. Most people had therefore made for their
homes more quickly than usual. We had fallen in with Damocleidas,
Pelopidas, and Theopompus, and were taking them with
us, as others took others of the exiles. For the party had broken
up immediately after crossing Cithaeron; and the bitter <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
weather allowed them to muffle up their faces and pass
through the city in security. Some of them were met by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>lightning flash on the right without thunder, as they entered
through the gates; and the sign seemed favourable for safety
and glory, with a bright issue to follow and no danger.</p>

<p class='c005'>XXVII. So when we were all inside, two short of fifty, while
Theocritus was sacrificing by himself in an outbuilding, there was
a loud knocking at the door; and presently some one came in to
say that two servants of Archias, sent on an urgent message to
Charon, were knocking at the courtyard gate and calling for it to
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> be opened, and were angry at the slowness of the response. Charon
was much disturbed, and gave orders to open to them at once,
while he himself went to meet them, the crown on his head showing
that he had sacrificed and was at his wine, and asked the messengers
what they wanted. One of them replied: ‘Archias and
Philippus sent us, you are to come to them as quickly as you can.’
When Charon asked, ‘What is the reason of this hasty summons,
and is there anything new?’ ‘We know nothing further,’ answered
the messenger, ‘but what shall we tell them?’ ‘This, by
Zeus,’ said Charon, ‘that as soon as I have put off this crown and
got my cloak, I will follow you. For, if I go straight off with
you, there will be an alarm; people will think that I am in
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>595<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> custody.’ ‘Do so,’ they said, ‘for we too have orders to convey
from the magistrates to the guard of the lower city.’ So they
went off. When Charon came in and told us this, we were all
aghast, thinking we had been betrayed. Most of us were inclined
to suspect Hippostheneidas; he had tried to hinder the return
by sending Chlidon, and when that failed and the dread moment
was upon us, he had used his plausible tongue to betray the scheme,
out of fear; for he did not come with the rest into the house, but
the whole impression he gave us was of a coward and turncoat.
However, we all thought that Charon ought to go, and obey the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> summons of the magistrates. He ordered his son to come in, the
handsomest boy in Thebes, Archidamus, and the most painstaking
in his gymnastics; barely fifteen, but in strength and size
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>far above others of his age. ‘Gentlemen,’ he said, ‘he is my only
one, and, as you know, I love him dearly; I place him in your hands,
and charge you in the name of the Gods, and in the name of the
spirits, if I should appear a traitor to your cause, slay him, and
spare us not. For the rest, my gallant friends, set yourselves to
meet the event; do not give in like shabby cowards, or allow this
scum to slay your bodies; defend yourselves, keep your souls <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
above defeat, they are our country’s!’ As Charon said this,
we were wondering at his spirit and noble heart, though indignant
at his idea of suspicion on our part, and bade him take the boy
away. ‘More than that, Charon,’ said Pelopidas, ‘we think that
you have not been well advised in that you have not already removed
your son to another house. What need for him to run our
risks if taken with us? You must send him away even now, so
that, if anything happen to us, one noble nursling may be left to
be our avenger on the tyrants.’ ‘Not so;’ said Charon, ‘here he
shall stay and share your risks; for, even in his interest, it is not <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
good that he should fall into the enemy’s hands. But you,
my boy, be daring beyond your years, taste the struggles which
must come, take risks with our many brave countrymen in the
cause of freedom and valour; much hope still is left, and I think
that a God is surely watching over us in our contest for the
right.’</p>

<p class='c005'>XXVIII. Tears came to many of us, Archidamus, at the
words of Charon. Dry-eyed himself and unmoved, he placed his
son in the hands of Pelopidas, and made his way through the doors
with a word of greeting and encouragement for each of us. Even
more would you have admired the bright and fearless bearing of
the boy himself in the peril. Like Neoptolemus,<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c006'><sup>[48]</sup></a> he showed no <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
paleness or alarm, but drew the sword of Pelopidas and seemed to
study it. In the meantime, Diotonus, a friend of Cephisodorus,
came in to us, sword in hand, and wearing a steel breastplate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>under his clothes; and when we told him of Charon being sent
for by Archias, blamed us for losing time, and implored us to
go straight to the houses, where we should be upon them before
they were ready; failing that, it would be better, he said, to go
out into the open and form our parties there out of the scattered
and uncombined units, rather than shut ourselves up in a chamber
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> and wait like a swarm of bees to be cut out by the enemy.
The prophet Theocritus added his urgent appeal; his victims
showed a clear and good result, and assured him of safety.</p>

<p class='c005'>XXIX. While we were arming and making arrangements,
Charon reappeared, his face radiant. Smiling as he looked at us,
he bade us take heart; there was no danger and the business was
moving on. ‘Archias’, he said, ‘and Philippus, when they heard
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>596<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> that I had obeyed their summons, were already heavy with drink,
sodden alike in body and mind; it was all they could do to stand
upon their feet and move out towards the door. When Archias
said: “Charon, we hear that exiles have passed into the city
and are being concealed”, I was not a little troubled. “Where are
they said to be?” I asked, “and who are they?” “We do not
know,” replied Archias, “and therefore ordered you to come, on
the chance that you might have heard something more certain.” I
took a moment to recover my senses, as if after a blow, and began
to put things together. The information given could be no substantial
story; the plot had not been betrayed by any of those
privy to it; for the tyrants could not be in ignorance as to
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> the house if their information came from any person with real
knowledge; it must be merely a suspicion or some indefinite
rumour circulating in the city which had reached them. So
I answered: “I remember that in the lifetime of Androcleidas
there were often reports of the kind floating idly about and
causing us annoyance. But at the present time, Archias,”
I went on, “I have heard nothing of the sort; however,
I will inquire into the story, if you so desire, and, if I hear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>anything worth attention, you shall not fail to know.” “By
all means,” said Phyllidas, “look well into this matter and leave
no stone unturned. What is to prevent us? We must think nothing
beneath our notice, but must take all precautions and pay
attention. Forethought is good; safety is good!” As he said <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
this, he took Archias by the arm and led him off into the house
where they are drinking. ‘Now, friends,’ he went on, ‘no delay
for us, a prayer to the Gods, and forth we go!’ When Charon had
said this, we spent a while in prayer and mutual encouragement.</p>

<p class='c005'>XXX. It was now the hour at which people are mostly at
supper; the wind was still rising and drove beneath it snow
with drizzle, so that the narrow streets were quite empty as
we made our way through them. The party told off against
Leontides and Hypates, who lived near one another, went
out cloaked and carrying no arms but a sword apiece (among <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
these were Pelopidas, Damocleidas, and Cephisodorus). Charon,
Melon, and the rest who were to attack Archias, wore half-cuirasses,
and thick wreaths, some of firwood, some of pine.
Some were in women’s tunics, which gave the effect of a drinking
procession with women. But our ill-fortune, Archidamus,
which set all the weakness and ignorance of the enemy on a level
with all our daring and preparation, and chequered our action
from the outset with perilous episodes like a stage play, met us at <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the moment of action, and sharp and terrible was the crisis with
its dramatic surprise. Charon, having satisfied Archias and Philippus,
had returned home and was putting us through our parts,
when there came a letter from this city; it was from Archias the
priest to Archias of Thebes, an old friend and guest, it would seem,
with full news of the return and plot of the exiles, of the house <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
to which they had repaired, and of those who were acting with
them. Archias was by this time drenched with wine, and excited
about the expected arrival of the ladies; he took the letter, but
when the bearer said that it was addressed to him about certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>urgent business: “Then urgent business to-morrow!” he
said, and thrust the letter under his head cushion; then he
asked for a cup, kept calling for wine, the whole time ordering
Phyllidas to go out to the door and see whether the women
were near.</p>

<p class='c005'>XXXI. As they had beguiled their drinking with this hope,
we joined the company, and pushing our way through the servants
to the banqueting hall stood a short time at the door looking
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>597<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> at each of the party. Our crowns and dress and make-up,
while apologizing for our presence, caused a silence: but as
soon as Melon rushed first up the hall, his hand upon his sword-hilt,
Cabirichus, the appointed president, plucked him by the
arm as he passed, and shouted out, ‘Phyllidas, is not this Melon?’
Melon shook off his grasp, drawing his sword as he did so, then,
rushing upon Archias as with difficulty he found his feet, struck
and struck till he had killed him. Philippus received a neck
wound from Charon; he tried to defend himself with the drinking-cups
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> which were near his hand, but Lysitheus threw him off
the couch to the ground and slew him. We tried to pacify
Cabirichus, imploring him not to assist the tyrants, but to join
in our country’s deliverance, remembering that he was a holy person
and consecrated to the Gods for her sake. As, however, from
the wine he had taken, it was not easy to carry his thoughts to
the proper course, while he stood excited and confused, and kept
presenting the point of his spear (customarily worn by our
magistrates at all times), I myself seized it at the middle and
swung it over his head, crying to him to let go and save himself,
or he would be wounded. But Theopompus, standing near him
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> on the right, struck him with his sword, and said: ‘Lie there
with those whom thou hast been flattering; never mayest thou
wear a crown in a free Thebes, nor sacrifice any longer to the
Gods, in whose names thou hast often called down curses on our
country, and prayers for her enemies!’ When Cabirichus was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>down, Theocritus, who was with us, snatched the sacred spear
out of the wound; and we slew a few of the servants who ventured
on resistance, while we shut up in the hall those who behaved
quietly, not wishing them to slip away and spread news of
what had happened, before we knew whether things had gone <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
well with our comrades also.</p>

<p class='c005'>XXXII. Their history was this. Pelopidas and his party
quietly approached the courtyard door of Leontides, and told
the servant who answered their knock that they had come from
Athens with letters for Leontides from Callistratus. When he
had given the message and received orders to open, and had removed
the bar and set the door a little ajar, they burst in in a
body, upset the man, and charged on through the court to the
bedroom of Leontides. His suspicions carrying him at once to
the truth he drew his dagger and rushed to defend himself; an
unjust and tyrannical man he was, but of sturdy courage and a <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
powerful fighter. However, he did not make up his mind to
throw down the torch and close with the attacking party in the
dark; but in the light, and in their full view, as soon as they began
to open the door, he smote Cephisodorus on the groin, and
closed with Pelopidas next, shouting loudly all the time to call
the attendants. These were held in check by Samidas’ party,
not venturing to come to blows with some of the best known and
bravest men in Thebes. Pelopidas and Leontides had to fight it <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
out; it was a sword duel in the doorway of the chamber, a
narrow one, in the middle of which lay Cephisodorus, fallen and
dying, so that the others could not come in to the rescue. At
last our man, having received a slight wound in the head and
having given many, and thrown Leontides down, ran him
through over the still warm body of Cephisodorus. The latter
saw the enemy falling, and placed his hand in that of Pelopidas,
saluted the others, and cheerfully breathed his last. Leaving
them, they turned against Hypates, and the door having been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>opened to them there, in the same way, they cut him down
while trying to escape over a roof to the neighbours.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>598<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> XXXIII. Thence they hastened towards us, joining us outside,
near the Polystyle. After mutual greetings and talk, we
proceeded to the prison. Phyllidas called the head jailer out and
said: ‘Archias and Philippus order you to bring Amphitheus
to them at once.’ He, remarking the strangeness of the hour,
and that Phyllidas did not seem composed as he spoke to him, but
hot from the struggle and excited, saw through our artifice:
‘When did the Polemarchs send for a prisoner at such an hour,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Phyllidas,’ he asked, ‘and when by you? What password do you
bring?’ As he was speaking, Phyllidas, who carried a cavalry
lance, drove it through his ribs and brought the scoundrel to the
ground, where he was trampled and spat upon the next day by
a number of women. We burst open the doors of the prison, and
called on the prisoners by name; first Amphitheus, then our
acquaintances among the others. As they recognized the voices
they leapt up from their pallet beds, dragging their chains, while
those whose feet were fast in the stocks stretched out their hands,
shouting and imploring us not to leave them behind. As these
were being released, many of those who lived near came up, perceiving
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> what was going on and delighting in it. The women, as
soon as each heard about her own relation, dropped Boeotian
habits, and ran out to one another, asking questions from the men
who met them. Those who found their own fathers or husbands
followed, and no one tried to hinder them, for all who met them
were deeply affected by pity for the men, and by the tears
and prayers of modest women.</p>

<p class='c005'>XXXIV. While things were thus, learning that Epaminondas
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> and Gorgidas were already forgathering with our friends near the
temple of Athena, I took my way to join them. Many loyal
citizens had already arrived, and more kept pouring in. When
I had told them in detail the story of what had happened, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>while I was imploring them to rally to the market-place, all
agreed to summon the citizens at once ‘For Liberty!’ The
crowds now forming up found arms to their hand in the warehouses
full of spoils from all lands and in the factories of the
swordmakers living near. Hippostheneidas had also arrived with
friends and servants, bringing the trumpeters, who had, as it
happened, been quartered in the town for the feast of Hercules.
All at once they began to sound calls, some in the market-place, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
others elsewhere, from every direction, to cause a panic among
the other side, and make them think that the rising was general.
Some lighted smoky fires<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c006'><sup>[49]</sup></a> and so escaped to the Cadmeia, drawing
with them also the aristocrats, so called, who were accustomed
to pass the night on the low ground near the fortress.
Those who were above, seeing this disorderly and confused
stream of incomers, and ourselves about the market-place, no
quiet anywhere, but indistinct noise and bustle rising up to
them from all quarters, never made up their minds to come
down, though there were some five thousand of them. They <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
thoroughly lost their heads in the danger, and Lysanoridas was a
mere excuse: they professed to wait for his return, which was
due that day. In consequence, he was afterwards sentenced to
a heavy fine by the Lacedaemonian senate. Herippidas and
Arcesus were arrested at Corinth later on and put to death. The
Cadmeia was evacuated by them and surrendered to us under
treaty, and the garrison withdrawn.</p>

  <h2 id='chap02' class='c003'>THREE PYTHIAN DIALOGUES</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c009'>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p class='c004'>The three Dialogues of Plutarch entitled:</p>

<p class='c012'>I. On the E at Delphi,</p>

<p class='c013'>II. Why the Pythia does not now give her Oracles in Verse,</p>

<p class='c013'>III. On the cessation of the Oracles,</p>

<p class='c011'>may be conveniently treated as a group, and assumed to be a collection
of those ‘Pythian Dialogues’ which the author sent to
his friend Serapion. I and II certainly are so, III has a separate
dedication. Other Dialogues, e. g. that on <i>Delays in Divine
Punishment</i>, are also records of conversations which took place at
Delphi; but these three are concerned with questions suggested
by the temple and prophetic office of Apollo, as to
which they give much curious information. If they leave us unsatisfied
as to matters of still deeper interest, and tell us nothing
about the policy of Delphi in the Persian wars, the counsel given
to Orestes, which is fiercely controversial matter, or the popular
feeling towards the oracle represented in the <i>Ion</i> of Euripides,
this is only what we learn to put up with in reading Greek books.
Indeed it is of a piece with the purposes imputed to Apollo
himself, who sets us problems but does not supply their solution.
‘The king whose oracle is in Delphi neither tells nor conceals,
but signifies.’</p>

<p class='c005'>We have few indications of date, or of mutual relations between
the three Dialogues. I is based upon the author’s recollection
of a conversation which took place ‘a long time ago’,
about <span class='fss'>A. D.</span> 66, the date of Nero’s visit to Greece. A principal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>speaker is Ammonius the Peripatetic philosopher of Lamprae,
Plutarch’s instructor, who also speaks, with the same authority,
in III. In II, Serapion, the Athenian poet, to whom the collection
is dedicated in I, takes a leading part. Theon, a literary
friend, who appears frequently in the <i>Symposiacs</i> and in the <i>Face
in the Moon</i> comes into I and II. An interesting person is Demetrius
of Tarsus, another literary friend, who, in III, has just returned
from Britain, and who has been probably identified with
‘Demetrius the Scribe’, named on two bronze tablets found at
York, and now in the York Museum (see <i>Hermes</i>, vol. 46, p. 156).
The year of Callistratus at Delphi, which marks the date of III,
is conjecturally fixed as <span class='fss'>A. D.</span> 83-4 (see Pontow in <i>Philologus</i>
for 1895, and cp. <i>Sympos.</i> vii. 5). As Agricola’s term of office
ended in <span class='fss'>A. D.</span> 84 or 85, Demetrius may have served under him.
The general tranquillity of the world depicted in III hardly
gives us much to build upon.</p>

<p class='c005'>In I Plutarch and his brother Lamprias are both speakers.
Lamprias appears in his usual character, a good companion, light-hearted
and reckless; Plutarch speaks gravely and at length, and
the debate is closed by Ammonius. In III Lamprias, Plutarch
not being named, speaks gravely throughout, and, on the
suggestion of Ammonius, closes the debate. In II, neither
brother is named, and the last speaker is Theon.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the Symposiac Dialogues one or other brother is usually
present, sometimes both. In the <i>Face in the Moon</i> Lamprias
alone takes part, and he acts as moderator.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is not easy to interpret these facts. M. Gréard concludes
that Lamprias died early. If so, was the name, which was borne
by the grandfather and by one of the sons, transferred, for
literary purposes, to Plutarch himself? M. Chenevière, in his
pleasant essay on Plutarch’s friends (a Latin prize dissertation)
suggests that, under whatever name, the leading speaker
always conveys Plutarch’s own views.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Certain topics recur in this series of Dialogues. Thus the
problem as to the meaning of the E at Delphi, which is the
main subject of I, is glanced at, with some impatience, by
Philippus the historian in III.</p>

<p class='c005'>The identification of Apollo with the sun, dismissed at the end
of I as a mere beautiful fancy, is questioned again in III and
allowed to stand over as unsettled. It is touched upon in II,
c. 12.</p>

<p class='c005'>The hypothesis of a plurality of worlds, brought forward by
Plutarch in I. c. 11, with special reference to the views of
Plato in the <i>Timaeus</i>, reappears, again in connexion with the
five regular solids, in III.</p>

<p class='c005'>It may be noticed that Plutarch was not, at the date of
the conversation narrated in I, a priest of the temple (see c. 16).</p>

<p class='c005'>Much of the matter of III reappears, with little variety of
substance, in the <i>Face in the Moon</i>, the attack on Aristotle’s
theory of the distribution of matter in the one corresponding to
that upon the Stoics in the other, and the accounts of the
imprisonment of Cronus by his son (or Briareus) being almost
identical. It is probable that in both Plutarch has drawn immediately
upon Posidonius, and through him from Xenocrates
and others. The question is discussed with great thoroughness
by Dr. Max Adler (<i>Dissertationes Vindobonenses</i>, 1910).</p>

<p class='c005'>The situation of Delphi is one of extraordinary beauty, as well
as interest:</p>

<p class='c012'>Some few miles north-east of the ancient site of Cirrha the
mountainous range of Parnassus shoots out two little spurs
towards the sea, thus locking on three sides an inclined valley,
as the tiers of an ancient circus embrace the arena below.
Upon the fourth side a small river runs, by name the Pleistus,
which has forced its way between the eastern spur and Mount
Cirphius, directly south and opposite; crosses laterally at the
foot of the glen; then, sweeping round in a shining curve,
before many leagues unites its waters to the bay. The descending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>slope that forms the amphitheatre is broken by ridges into
three terraces, such as the traveller is wont to see in hilly countries.
On the highest rose the sanctuary; below was the town
and the cultivated hollow which poets called the Vale of Delphi;
above all towered the ridges of Parnassus itself,<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c006'><sup>[50]</sup></a> sheer walls of
rock, rising inland towards the summit of the chain, desolate,
grand, and picturesque. Those who stood above the level of
the temple, and turned their gaze toward the south-west,
might perhaps have looked far over to the smiling gulf of
Corinth, an unbroken prospect of well-watered fields. Upon
their left was the famous plane-tree, and the spring of Castalia,
whose stream, leaping down between two rocks, out of a huge
cleft that divided them, lost itself in a dell below, till it fell
finally into the Pleistus; and mounting the rough ascent, just
beyond the little torrent, might be seen the sacred way, which,
issuing from the same gorge as the Pleistus, rounded the flank
of the promontory of rock and climbed up its warm side. Few
are the shadows that pass over the valley; through the long day
the southern sun beats down on it, and the brilliancy of the sky
is immortalized in the name which the inhabitants conferred
upon the hills about, of Phaedriades, or shining cliffs.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the property of the temple was not bounded by the
extent of the <i>view</i>. Above, on the heights, as far as Ligorea
and Tithorea, both Doric villages—towards the west, beyond
the Stadium, and the hill on which it nestled, to Amphissa and
the pasturages along its stream—all was part of the Ager Apollinis,
sacred to the god and to his priests for ever.</p>

<p class='c013'>From the Arnold Prize Essay for 1859, by Charles (afterwards
Lord) Bowen.</p>

<p class='c011'>The topographical and archaeological facts to be gathered
from authorities prior to modern excavations are collected by
Dr. J. H. Middleton in the <i>Journal of Hellenic Studies</i> for 1888.
The results of the subsequent work of the French excavators,
directed by M. Homolle, may conveniently be studied in
Dr. J. G. Frazer’s Commentary on Pausanias, Book 10, where
the history of the successive temples is followed out. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>dimensions of the temple itself, which stood on a rocky plateau
or terrace, were about 197 feet by 72 feet. The Sacred Way ran
round the temple, and close to it on its northern and western
sides, and was followed by the party described by Plutarch in
the second of the three Dialogues (c. 17) in order to reach the
southern steps.</p>

certain inscriptions (γράμματα): ‘Know thyself’—‘Nothing too much’—‘Go
bail and woe is at hand’—all exhortations to wisdom or prudence

</div>

<p class='c011'>Chap. 1. Dedication to Serapion at Athens. I am sending
you, as an instalment, some of my Pythian Dialogues. What is
the problem put before us by Apollo under the form of the letter
E? I had always avoided the question, but here is a report of
a conversation with some visitors, of whom Ammonius was one,
in, or soon after, the year <span class='fss'>A. D.</span> 66, when Nero came to Greece.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. <span class='sc'>Ammonius</span> was arguing that Apollo propounds subjects
for philosophical inquiry in the ordinances and emblems of his
temple, not least in this letter E.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. <span class='sc'>Lamprias</span> quoted the traditional account, that the Wise
Men, who were properly five, not seven, met here, and, after
discussion, set up the letter E, as a numeral, for a protest against
the intrusion of a sixth and seventh into their company. The
ancient wooden E is still called that of the Wise Men.</p>

<p class='c005'>4. <span class='sc'>Ammonius</span> smiled, knowing Lamprias to be capable of
improvising a ‘traditional view’. One of the company mentioned
a Chaldaean visitor, who had lately talked much nonsense
about the number seven. The officials of the temple know no
view except that the letter is significant as a word (‘if’ or
‘whether’).</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>5. <span class='sc'>Nicander</span> confirmed this. ‘If’ is used with us in the
formula of questions put to the god, or, as ‘if only’, in prayers.</p>

<p class='c005'>6. <span class='sc'>Theon</span> puts in a plea for ‘Dialectic’, i.e. Logic. ‘If’ is
the conjunction which holds together the conjunctive proposition
or syllogism, the special prerogative of <i>human</i> intellect.
Hercules, in his early days, mocked at Logic and the E, and then
removed the tripod by force.</p>

<p class='c005'>7. <span class='sc'>Eustrophus</span>: ‘Bravo, Theon, a Hercules, all but the lion’s
skin!’ He appeals to the devotees of Mathematics to say a word
for the arithmetical virtues of the number five (a thrust at
Plutarch himself, who had yet to learn Academic moderation in
his zeal for Mathematics).</p>

<p class='c005'>8-16. <span class='sc'>Plutarch</span> <i>loq.</i>:</p>

<p class='c005'>8. Yes, five has virtues: 5 = 2 + 3, the first even added to the
first odd. It is called ‘Marriage’. After multiplication it
reproduces itself, and so symbolizes the ‘Conflagration’ and
‘Renovation’ of Heraclitus (and the Stoics),</p>

<p class='c005'>9. Which relate to the legends of Apollo and also of Dionysus.</p>

<p class='c005'>10. Five, when multiplied, gives alternately five itself and
the perfect ten. It is also essential in harmonies.</p>

<p class='c005'>11. Plato holds that, <i>if</i> there are more worlds than one, there
<i>may</i> be five, and no more. Aristotle that there is one world
composed of five elements, the five regular solids.</p>

<p class='c005'>12. The five senses are related to the five elements and the five
solids.</p>

<p class='c005'>13. We must not forget Homer, and his five-fold division of
the universe. But, going back: Four dimensions (point, line,
plane, solid) are all very well. But animate being requires a
fifth.</p>

<p class='c005'>14. The true derivation is not 2 + 3 = 5 but 1 + 4 i.e., unity
(which is itself really a square) <i>plus</i> the first square.</p>

<p class='c005'>15. There are five modes of being (see the <i>Sophist</i>, and
<i>Philebus</i> of Plato). Some early inquirer saw this, and set up
<i>two</i> E’s.</p>

<p class='c005'>16. I ask the initiated whether five has not a special virtue in
their mysteries. (‘Yes,’ from <span class='sc'>Nicander</span>, ‘but it is a secret.’)
Well I must wait till I become a priest myself.</p>

<p class='c005'>17. <span class='sc'>Ammonius</span>, though in sympathy with Mathematics,
deprecates too much exactness. There is much to be said for
the number seven. But the ‘E’ is really something different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>from all the suggestions. The God greets his visitors with
‘Know Thyself.’ They answer, <span class='sc'>Thou Art</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>18. <i>We</i> ‘are’ not at all, but always change from state to
state, and so (says Heraclitus) does all Nature.</p>

<p class='c005'>19. In true being is no past, present, or future; our common
speech confesses to our not being.</p>

<p class='c005'>20. But God IS, and is rightly addressed as ‘Thou Art’ or
‘Thou Art One’.</p>

<p class='c005'>21. The identification of Apollo with the sun is a beautiful
attempt to grasp the spiritual through the sensible. Not so the
stories of his change into fire, and the like, which are better
ascribed to some daemon than to the God. ‘Know Thyself’
calls us back from these lofty speculations: ‘Man, know thy
nature and its limitations!’</p>
<h3 class='c009'>ON THE ‘E’ AT DELPHI</h3>
<p class='c004'>I. A day or two ago, dear Serapion, I met with some <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>384 <span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
rather good lines, addressed, Dicaearchus thinks, to Archelaus
by Euripides:<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c006'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>No gifts, my wealthy friend, from humble me;</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>You’ll think me fool, or think I did but beg.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>He who out of his narrow store offers trifles to men of great
possessions, confers no favour; no one believes that he gives
something for nothing, and he gets credit for a jealous and
ungenerous temper. Now surely as money presents fall far <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
below those of literature and learning, so there is beauty in giving
these, and beauty in claiming a return in kind. At any rate,
I am sending to you, and so to my friends down there, some of
our Pythian Dialogues, as a sort of first-fruits; and, in doing
so, confess that I expect others from you, and more and better
ones, since you enjoy a great city and abundant leisure, with
many books and discussions of every sort. Well then, our kind
Apollo, in the oracles which he gives his consultants, seems to <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>solve the problems of life and to find a remedy, while problems
of the intellect he actually suggests and propounds to the born
love of wisdom in the soul, thus implanting an appetite which
leads to truth. Among many other instances, this is made
clear as to the consecration of the letter ‘E’. We may well
guess that it was not by chance, or by lot, that, alone among
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>385<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> the letters, it received pre-eminence in the God’s house, and
took rank as a sacred offering and a show object. No, the
officials of the God in early times, when they came to speculate,
either saw in it a special and extraordinary virtue, or found it
a symbol for something else of serious importance, and so adopted
it. I had often myself avoided the question and quietly declined
it when raised in the school. However, I was lately surprised
by my sons in earnest discussion with certain strangers, who
were just starting from Delphi; it was not decent to put
them off with excuses, they were so anxious to receive some
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> account. We sat down near the temple, and I began to raise
questions with myself, and to put others to them; and the
place, and what they said, reminded me of a discussion which
we heard a long time ago from Ammonius and others, at the
time of Nero’s visit, when the same problem had been started
here in the same way.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. That the God is no less philosopher than he is prophet
appeared to all to come out directly from the exposition which
Ammonius gave us of each of his names. He is ‘Pythian’
(The Inquirer) to those who are beginning to learn and to
inquire; ‘Delian’ (The Clear One) and ‘Phanaean’ to those
who are already getting something clear and a glimmering of
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> the truth; ‘Ismenian’ (The Knowing) to those who possess
the knowledge; ‘Leschenorian’ (God of Discourse) when
they are in active enjoyment of dialectical and philosophic
intercourse. ‘Now since’, he continued, ‘Philosophy embraces
inquiry, wonder, and doubt, it seems natural that most of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>things relating to the God should have been hidden away in
riddles, and should require some account of their purpose, and
an explanation of cause. For instance, in the case of the undying
fire, why the only woods used here are pine for burning
and laurel for fumigation; again, why two Fates are here installed,
whereas their number is everywhere else taken as three;
why no woman is allowed to approach the place of the oracles;
questions about the tripod, and the rest. These problems, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
when suggested to persons not altogether wanting in reason and
soul, lure them on, and challenge them to inquire, to listen,
and to discuss. Look again at those inscriptions, <span class='fss'>KNOW THYSELF</span>
and <span class='fss'>NOTHING TOO MUCH</span>; how many philosophic inquiries
have they provoked! What a multitude of arguments has
sprung up out of each, as from a seed! Not one of them I think
is more fruitful in this way than the subject of our present
inquiry.’</p>

<p class='c005'>III. When Ammonius had said this, my brother Lamprias
spoke: ‘After all, the account which we have heard of the
matter is simple enough and quite short. They say that the
famous Wise Men, also called by some “Sophists”, were <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
properly only five, Chilon, Thales, Solon, Bias, and Pittacus.
But Cleobulus, tyrant of Lindos, and, later on, Periander of
Corinth, men with no wisdom or virtue in them, but forcing
public opinion by influence, friends, and favours, thrust themselves
into the list of the wise, and disseminated through Greece
maxims and sayings resembling the utterances of the five.
Then the five were vexed, but did not choose to expose the
imposture, or to have an open quarrel on the matter of title,
and to fight it out with such powerful persons. They met here <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
by themselves; and after discussing the matter, dedicated
the letter which is fifth in the alphabet, and also as a numeral
signifies five, thus making their own protest before the God,
that they were five, discarding and rejecting the seventh and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>sixth, as having no part or lot with themselves. That this
account is not beside the mark may be recognized by any one
who has heard the officials of the temple naming the golden
“E” as that of Livia the wife of Caesar, the brazen one as that
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>386<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> of the Athenians, whereas the original and oldest letter, which
is of wood, is to this day called that “Of the Wise Men”, as
having been the offering of all in common, not of anyone of them.’</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. Ammonius gave a quiet smile; he had a suspicion that
Lamprias had been giving us a view of his own, making up
history and legend at discretion. Some one else said that it
was like the nonsense which they had heard from the Chaldaean
stranger a day or so before; that there were seven letters which
were vowels, seven stars that have an independent motion and
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> are unattached to the heavens; moreover that ‘E’ is the
second vowel from the beginning, and the sun the second planet,
after the moon, and that all Greeks, or nearly all, identify
Apollo with the sun.</p>

<p class='c005'>‘But all that’, he said, ‘is pernicious nonsense. Lamprias,
however, has, probably without knowing it, made a move<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c006'><sup>[52]</sup></a>
which stirs up all who have to do with the temple against his
view. What he told us was unknown to any of the Delphians;
they used to give the regular guides’ account, that neither the
appearance nor the sound of the letter has any significance, but
only the name.’</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> V. ‘No, the Delphic Officials’, said Nicander the priest,
speaking for them, ‘believe that it is a vehicle, a form assumed
by the petition addressed to the God; it has a leading place in
the questions of those who consult him, and inquire, <i>If</i> they
shall conquer; <i>If</i> they shall marry; <i>If</i> it is advisable to sail;
<i>If</i> to farm; <i>If</i> to travel. The God in his wisdom would bow out
the dialecticians when they think that nothing practical comes
of the “<i>If</i>” part with its clause attached; he admits as practical,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>in his sense of the word, all questions so attached. Then,
since it is our personal concern to question him as prophet, but <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
a general concern to pray to him as God, they hold that the
letter embraces the virtue of prayer no less than that of inquiry;
“O, If I might!” says every one who prays, as Archilochus,<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c006'><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>When <i>If-so-be</i> is used, the latter part is dragged in (compare
Sophron’s “Bereaved of children, I trow”, or Homer’s “As
I will break thy might, I trow”<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c006'><sup>[54]</sup></a>). But <i>If</i> gives the sense of
prayer sufficiently.’</p>

<p class='c005'>VI. When Nicander had finished, our friend Theon, whom
I am sure you know, asked Ammonius whether Dialectic might <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
speak freely, after the insulting remarks to which she had been
treated. Ammonius told him to speak out on her behalf.
‘That the God is a master of Dialectic,’ Theon said, ‘is shown
clearly by most of his oracles; for you will grant that the
solution of puzzles belongs to the same person as their invention.
Again, as Plato used to say, when a response was given that the
altar at Delos should be doubled,<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c006'><sup>[55]</sup></a> a matter requiring the most
advanced geometry, the God was not merely enjoining this,
but was also putting his strong command upon the Greeks to
practise geometry. Just so, when the God puts out ambiguous <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
oracles, he is exalting and establishing Dialectic, as essential to
the right understanding of himself. You will grant again, that
in Dialectic this conjunctive particle has great force, because it
formulates the most logical of all sentences. This is certainly
the “conjunctive”, seeing that the other animals know the
existence of things, but man alone has been gifted by nature
with the power of observing and discerning their sequence.
That “it is day” and “it is light” we may take it that wolves
and dogs and birds perceive. But “if it is day it is light”, is <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>387<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>intelligible only to man; he alone can apprehend antecedent
and consequent, the enunciation of each and their connexion,
their mutual relation and difference, and it is in these that all
demonstration has its first and governing principle. Since
then Philosophy is concerned with truth, and the light of truth
is demonstration, and the principle of demonstration is the
conjunctive proposition, the faculty which includes and produces
this was rightly consecrated by the wise men to that
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> God who is above all things a lover of truth. Also, the God is
a prophet, and prophetic art deals with that future which is to
come out of things present or things past. Nothing comes into
being without a cause, nothing is known beforehand without
a reason. Things which come into being follow things which
have been, things which are to be follow things which now are
coming into being, all bound in one continuous chain of evolution.
Therefore he who knows how to link causes together into
one, and combine them into a natural process, can also declare
beforehand things</p>

<p class='c011'>Homer did well in putting the present first, the future next,
and the past last. Inference starts with the present, and works
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> by the force of the conjunction: “If this is, that was its antecedent”,
“If this is, that will be.” As we have said, the
technical and logical requirement is knowledge of consequence;
sense supplies the minor premiss. Hence, though it may
perhaps seem a petty thing to say, I will not shrink from it;
the real tripod of truth is the logical process which assumes the
relation of consequent to antecedent, then introduces the fact,
and so establishes the conclusion. If the Pythian God really
finds pleasure in music, and in the voices of swans, and the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> tones of the lyre, what wonder is it that as a friend to Dialectic,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>he should welcome and love that part of speech which he sees
philosophers use more, and more often, than any other. So
Hercules, when he had not yet loosed Prometheus, nor yet
conversed with the sophists Chiron and Atlas, but was young
and just a Boeotian, first abolished Dialectic, made a mock at
the “<i>If the first then the second</i>”<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c006'><sup>[57]</sup></a>, and bethought him to remove
the tripod by force, and to try conclusions with the God
for his art. At any rate, as time went on, he also appears to <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
have become a great prophet and a great dialectician.’</p>

<p class='c005'>VII. When Theon had done, I think it was Eustrophus of
Athens who addressed us: ‘Do you see with what a will Theon
backs Dialectic? He has only to put on the lion’s skin! Now
then for you who put down under number all things in one mass,
all natures and principles divine as well as human, and take it to
be leader and lord in all that is beautiful and honourable! It
is no time for you to keep quiet; offer to the God a first-fruits
of your dear Mathematics, if you think that “E” rises above <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the other letters, not in its own right by power or shape, or by
its meaning as a word, but as the honoured symbol of an absolutely
great and sovereign number, the “Pempad”, from which
the Wise Men took their verb “to count”.’ Eustrophus was
not jesting when he said this to us; he said it because I was at
the time passionately devoted to Mathematics, though soon to
find the value of the maxim, ‘<span class='fss'>NOTHING TOO MUCH</span>‘, having
joined the Academy.</p>

<p class='c005'>VIII. So I said that Eustrophus’ solution of the problem
by number was excellent. ‘For since,’ I continued, ‘when all
number is divided into even and odd, unity alone is in its effect <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>388<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
common to both, and therefore, if added to an odd number makes
it even, and vice versa; and since even numbers start with two,
odd numbers with three, and five is produced by combination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>of these, it has rightly received honour as the product of first
principles, and it has further been called “Marriage”, because
even resembles the female, odd the male. For when we divide
the several numbers into equal segments, the even parts asunder
perfectly, and leaves inside a sort of recipient principle or space;
if the odd is treated in the same way, a middle part is always left
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> over, which is generative. Hence the odd is the more generative,
and when brought into combination invariably prevails; in no
combination does it give an even result, but in all cases an odd.
Moreover, when each is applied to itself and added, the difference
is shown. Even with even never gives odd, or passes out
of its proper nature; it wants the strength to produce anything
different. Odd numbers with odd yield even numbers in
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> plenty because of their unfailing fertility. The other powers
of numbers and their distinctions cannot be now pursued in
detail. However, the Pythagoreans called five “Marriage”, as
produced by the union of the first male number and the first
female. From another point of view it has been called “Nature”,
because when multiplied into itself it ends at last in
itself. For as Nature takes a grain of wheat, and in the intermediate
stages of growth gives forms and shapes in abundance,
through which she brings her work to perfection, and, after
them all, shows us again a grain of wheat, thus restoring the
beginning in the end of the whole process, so it is with numbers.
When other numbers are multiplied into themselves, they end
in different numbers after being squared; only those formed
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> of five or of six recover and preserve themselves every time.
Thus six times six gives thirty-six, five times five twenty-five.
And again, a number formed of six does this only once, in
the single case of being squared. Five has the same property
in multiplication, and also a special property of its own when
added to itself; it produces alternately itself or ten, and that
to infinity. For this number mimics the principle which orders
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>all things. As Heraclitus<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c006'><sup>[58]</sup></a> tells us that Nature successively produces
the universe out of herself and herself out of the universe,
bartering “fire for things and things for fire, as goods for gold <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and gold for goods”, even so it is with the Pempad. In union
with itself, it does not by its nature produce anything imperfect
or foreign. All its changes are defined; it either produces
itself or the Decad, either the homogeneous or the perfect.</p>

<p class='c005'>IX. ‘Then if any one ask “What is all this to Apollo?”<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c006'><sup>[59]</sup></a>
Much, we will answer, not to Apollo only but also to Dionysus,
who has no less to do with Delphi than has Apollo. Now we <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
hear theologians saying or singing, in poems or in plain prose,
that the God subsists indestructible and eternal, and that, by
force of some appointed plan and method, he passes through
changes of his person; at one time he sets fire to Nature and so
makes all like unto all, at another passes through all phases of
difference—shapes, sufferings, powers—at the present time, for
instance, he becomes “Cosmos”, and that is his most familiar
name. The wiser people disguise from the vulgar the change <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>389<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
into fire, and call him “Apollo<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c006'><sup>[60]</sup></a>” from his isolation, “Phoebus<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c006'><sup>[61]</sup></a>”
from his undefiled purity. As for his passage and distribution
into waves and water, and earth, and stars, and nascent plants
and animals, they hint at the actual change undergone as
a rending and dismemberment, but name the God himself
Dionysus or Zagreus or Nyctelius or Isodaites. Deaths too and
vanishings do they construct, passages out of life and new births,
all riddles and tales to match the changes mentioned. So they
sing to Dionysus dithyrambic strains, charged with sufferings
and a change wherein are wanderings and dismemberment. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>‘But Apollo has the Paean, a set and sober music. Apollo is

<p class='c011'>‘So do they summon him, rightly catching the character of
either change. But since the periods of change are not equal, that

here preserve a proportion, and use the Paean with their sacrifice
for the rest of the year, but at the beginning of winter awake
the dithyramb, and stop the Paean, and invoke this God instead
of the other, supposing that this ratio of three to one is that of
the “Arrangement” to the “Conflagration”.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c006'><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>X. ‘But perhaps this has been drawn out at too great length
for the present opportunity. This much is clear, that they do
associate the Pempad with the God, as it now produces its own
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> self like fire, and again produces the Decad out of itself like the
universe. Now take music, which the God favours so highly,
are we not to suppose that this number has its share here?</p>

<p class='c005'>‘Most of the science of harmonies, to put it in a word, is
concerned with consonances. That these are five and no more
is proved by reason, as against the man who is all for strings and
holes, and wants to explore these points irrationally by the senses;
they all have their origin in numerical ratios. The ratio of the
fourth is four to three, of the fifth three to two, of the octave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>two to one, of the octave and fifth three to one, of the double
octave four to one. The additional consonance which writers of <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
harmony introduce under the name of octave and fourth, does
not merit admission, being extra-metrical; to admit it would
be to indulge the irrational side of our sense of hearing, and to
violate reason, or law. Passing by then five arrangements of
tetrachords, and the first five “tones”, or “tropes”, or “harmonies”,
whichever name is right, by variations of which,
made higher or lower, the remaining scales, high and low, are
produced, is it not true that, though intervals are many, indeed
infinite, the principles of melody are five only, quarter tone, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
half tone, tone, tone and a half, double tone? In sounds no
other interval of high and low, be it smaller or greater, can
be used for melody.</p>

<p class='c005'>XI. ‘Passing over many similar points, I will’, I said, ‘produce
Plato,<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c006'><sup>[64]</sup></a> who, in discussing the question of a single universe,
says that if there are others besides ours, and it is not alone, then
the whole number of them is five and no more; not but that,
if ours is the only universe in being, as Aristotle<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c006'><sup>[65]</sup></a> also thinks,
even this one is in a fashion composite and formed out of five;
one of earth, one of water, a third of fire, and a fourth of air, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>390<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
while the fifth is called heaven or light or air, or by others “fifth
substance”, to which alone of all bodies circular motion is
natural, not due to force or other accidental cause. Therefore
it is that Plato, observing the five perfect figures of Nature—Pyramid,
Cube, Octahedron, Eicosahedron, and Dodecahedron—assigned
them to the elements, each to each.</p>

<p class='c005'>XII. ‘There are some who appropriate to the same elements
our own senses, also five in number. Touch, as they see, is <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
resistent and earthy. Taste takes in properties by moisture in
the things tasted. Air when struck becomes audible voice or
sound. There remain two: smell, the object of our olfactory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>sense, is an exhalation engendered by heat, and so resembles fire;
sight is akin to air and light, which give it a luminous passage,
so there is a commixture of both which is sympathetic. Besides
these, the animal has no other sense, and the universe no other
substance, which is simple and not blended. A marvellous
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> apportionment of the five to the five!’</p>

<p class='c005'>XIII. Here, I think, I paused, and after an interval I went
on: ‘What has happened to us, Eustrophus? We have almost
forgotten Homer,<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c006'><sup>[66]</sup></a> as if he had not been the first to divide the
universe into five parts, assigning the three in the middle to the
three Gods, while he left common and unapportioned the two
extremes, Olympus and earth, one the limit of what is below,
the other of what is above. “We must cry back”, as Euripides
says.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c006'><sup>[67]</sup></a> Now those who exalt the number four as the basis of the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> genesis of every body, make out a fairly good case. For every
solid body possesses length, breadth, and depth; but length
presupposes a point as an unit; the line is called length without
breadth, and is length; the movement of a line in breadth
produces a plane surface, and that is three; add depth, and we
get to a solid with four factors. Any one can see that the
number four carries Nature up to this point, that is, to the
formation of a complete body, which may be touched, weighed,
or struck; there it has left her, wanting in what is greatest.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> For that which has no soul is, in plain terms, orphaned and incomplete
and fit for nothing, unless it be employed by soul.
But the movement or disposition which sets soul therein—a
change introducing a fifth factor—restores to Nature her completeness,
its rational basis is as much more commanding than
that of the Tetrad as the animal is above the inanimate. Further,
the symmetry and potency of the whole five prevails, so as not
to allow the animate to form classes without limit, but gives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>five types for all living things. There are Gods, we know, and <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
daemons, and heroes, and after these, fourth in all, the race of
men: fifth, and last, the irrational order of brutes. Again, if
you make a natural division of the soul itself, the first and least
distinct principle is that of growth; second is that of sense, then
comes appetite, then the spirited part; when it has reached
the power of reasoning and perfected its nature, it stays at rest
in the fifth stage as its upper limit.</p>

<p class='c005'>XIV. ‘Now as this number five has powers so many and so
great, its origin is also noble: not the process already described,
out of the numbers two and three, but that given by the combination
of the first principle of number with the first square.
The first principle is unity, the first square is four; from these <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>391<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
as from idea and limited substance, comes five. Or, if it be
really correct, as some hold, to reckon unity as a square, being
a power of itself and working out to itself, then the Pempad is
formed out of the first two squares, and so has not missed noble
birth and that the highest.</p>

<p class='c005'>XV. ‘My most important point’, I went on, ‘may, I fear,
bear hardly on Plato, just as he said that Anaxagoras “was hardly
used by the name Selene”, when he had wished to appropriate
the theory of her illumination, really a very old one. Are not <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
these Plato’s words, in the <i>Cratylus</i>?‘<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c006'><sup>[68]</sup></a> ‘They certainly are,’ said
Eustrophus, ‘but I fail to see the resemblance.’ ‘Very well
then; you know, I suppose, that in the “<i>Sophist</i>”<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c006'><sup>[69]</sup></a> he proves
that the supreme principles are five: being, identity, difference,
and after these, as fourth and fifth, movement and position.
But in the <i>Philebus</i><a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c006'><sup>[70]</sup></a> he divides on a different plan. He distinguishes
the unlimited and the limited, from whose combination
comes the origin of all being. The cause of combination he
takes to be a fourth. The fifth, whereby things so mingled are
again parted and distinguished, he has left to us to guess. I <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> conjecture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>that those on the one list are figures of those on the
other; to being corresponds that which becomes, to motion
the unlimited; to position the limited, to identity the combining
principle, to difference that which distinguishes. But
if the two sets are different, yet, on one view as on the other,
there would be five classes, and five modes of difference. Some
early inquirer, it will surely be said, saw into this before Plato,
and consecrated two “E’s” to the God, as a manifestation and
symbol of the number of all things. But further, having perceived
that the good also takes shape under five heads, firstly
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> moderation, secondly symmetry, thirdly mind, fourthly the
sciences and arts and true opinions which relate to soul, fifthly
every pleasure which is pure and unmingled with what causes
pain, he there leaves off, merely suggesting the Orphic verse,</p>

not be disclosed to others.’ ‘Then,’ I answered with a smile,
‘until such time as we become priests, and the God allows us to
know the truth, this much and no more shall be added to what
we have to say about the Pempad.’ Such, so far as I remember,
was the end of our account of the arithmetical or mathematical
reasons for extolling the letter ‘E’.</p>

<p class='c005'>XVII. Ammonius, as one who himself gave Mathematics
no mean place in Philosophy, was pleased at the course the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>conversation was taking, and said: ‘It is not worth our while
to answer our young friends with too absolute accuracy on these

provide not a few points for those who choose to sing its praises. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Why speak about the others? Apollo’s holy “Seven” will take
up all one day before we have exhausted its powers. Are we
then to show the Seven Wise Men at odds with common
usage, and “the time which runs”<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c006'><sup>[72]</sup></a>, and to suppose that they
ousted the “Seven” from its pre-eminence before the God,
and consecrated the “Five” as perhaps more appropriate?</p>

<p class='c005'>‘My own view is that the letter signifies neither number, nor <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>392<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
order, nor conjunction, nor any other omitted part of speech;
it is a complete and self-operating mode of addressing the God;
the word once spoken brings the speaker into apprehension of
his power. The God, as it were, addresses each of us, as he
enters, with his “<span class='sc'>Know Thyself</span>”, which is at least as good as
“Hail”. We answer the God back with “EI” (Thou Art),
rendering to him the designation which is true and has no lie in

of itself. If you strain the intellect, and wish to grasp this, it <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
is as with water; compress it too much and force it violently
into one space as it tries to flow through, and you destroy the
enveloping substance; even so when the reason tries to follow
out too closely the clear truth about each particular thing in
a world of phase and change, it is foiled, and rests either on the
becoming of that thing or on its perishing; it cannot apprehend
anything which abides or really is. “It is impossible to go
into the same river twice”, said Heraclitus;<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c006'><sup>[73]</sup></a> no more can you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>grasp mortal being twice, so as to hold it. So sharp and so
swift is change; it scatters and brings together again, nay not
again, no nor afterwards; even while it is being formed it fails,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> it approaches, and it is gone. Hence becoming never ends in
being, for the process never leaves off, or is stayed. From seed
it produces, in its constant changes, an embryo, then an infant,
then a child; in due order a boy, a young man; then a man, an
elderly man, an old man; it undoes the former becomings and
the age which has been, to make those which come after. Yet
we fear (how absurdly!) a single death, we who have died so
many deaths, and yet are dying. For it is not only that, as
Heraclitus<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c006'><sup>[74]</sup></a> would say, “death of fire is birth of air”, and
“death of air is birth of water”; the thing is much clearer in
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> our own selves. The man in his strength is destroyed when
the old man comes into being, the young man was destroyed for
the man in his strength to be, so the boy for the young man, the
babe for the boy. He of yesterday has died into him of to-day;
he of to-day is dying into him of to-morrow. No one abides,
no one is; we that come into being are many, while matter is
driven around, and then glides away, about some one appearance
and a common mould. Else how is it, if we remain the same,
that the things in which we find pleasure now are different from
those of a former time; that we love, hate, admire, and censure
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> different things; that our words are different and our feelings;
that our look, our bodily form, our intellect are not the same
now as then? If a man does not change, these various conditions
are unnatural; if he does change, he is not the same man. But
if he is not the same man, he is not at all; his so-called being is
simply change and new birth of man out of man. In our
ignorance of what being is, sense falsely tells us that what
appears is.</p>

<p class='c005'>XIX. ‘What then really is? That which is eternal, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>never brought into being, is never destroyed, to which no time
ever brings change. Time is a thing which moves and takes
the fashion of moving matter, which ever flows or is a sort of
leaky vessel which holds destruction and becoming. Of time
we use the words “afterwards”, “before”, “shall be”, and <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
“has been”, each on its face an avowal of not being. For, in
this question of being, to say of a thing which has not yet come
into being, or which has already ceased from being, that “it
is”, is silly and absurd. When we strain to the uttermost our
apprehension of time, and say “it is at hand”, “it is here”, or
“now”, a rational development of the argument brings it all
to nothing. “Now” is squeezed out into the future or into
the past, as though we should try to see a point, which of
necessity passes away to right or left. But if the case be the <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>393<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
same with Nature, which is measured, as with time which
measures, nothing in it abides or really is. All things are
coming into being, or being destroyed, even while we measure
them by time. Hence it is not permissible, even in speaking
of that which is, to say that “it was”, or “it shall be”; these
all are inclinations, transitions, passages, for of permanent being
there is none in Nature.</p>

<p class='c005'>XX. ‘But the God <span class='fss'>IS</span>, we are bound to assert; he is, with
reference to no time but to that age wherein is no movement, or
time, or duration; to which nothing is prior or subsequent;
no future, no past, no elder, no younger, which by one long
“now” has made the “always” perfect. Only with reference
to this that which really is, is; it has not come into being, it is <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
not yet to be, it did not begin, it will not cease. Thus then
we ought to hail him in worship, and thus to address him as
“Thou Art”, aye, or in the very words of some of the old
people, “Ei Hen”, “Thou art one thing”.<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c006'><sup>[75]</sup></a> For the Divine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>is not many things, in the sense in which each one of us is made
up of ten thousand different and successive states, a scrap-heap
of units, a mob of individuals. No, that which is must be one,
as that which is one is. Variety, any difference in being, passes
to one side to produce that which is not. Therefore the first
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> of the names of the God is right, and the second, and the third.
“Apollo” (Not-many) denies plurality and excludes multitude.
Ieïus means one and one only; Phoebus, we know, is a word by
which the ancients expressed that which is clean and pure, even
as to this day the Thessalians, when their priests pass their
solemn days in strict seclusion outside the temple, apply to
them a verb formed from Phoebus. Now The One is transparent
and pure, pollution comes by commixture of this with
that, just as Homer,<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c006'><sup>[76]</sup></a> you remember, says of ivory dyed red that
it is stained, and dyers say of mingled pigments that they are
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> destroyed, and call the process “destruction”. Therefore it is
the property of that which is indestructible and pure to be
one and without admixture.</p>

<p class='c005'>XXI. ‘There are those who think that Apollo and the sun
are the same; we hail them and love them for the fair name
they give, and it is fitting to do so; for they associate their idea
of the God with that which they honour and desire more than
all other things which they know. But now that we see them
dreaming of the God in the fairest of nightly visions, let us rise
and encourage them to mount yet higher, to contemplate him
in a dream of the day, and to see his own being. Let them pay
honour also to the image of him and worship the principle of
increase which is about it; so far as what is of sense can lead
to what is of mind, a moving body to that which abides, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>allows presentments and appearances of his kind and blessed <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
self to shine through after a fashion. But as to transitions and
changes in himself, that he now discharges fire, and so is drawn
up, as they put it, or again presses down and strains himself
into earth and sea, winds and animals, and all the strange
passages into animals and also plants, piety forbids us so much
as to hear them. Otherwise the God will be a greater trifler
than the boy in Homer,<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c006'><sup>[77]</sup></a> for ever playing with the universe the
game which the boy plays with a pile of sand, which is heaped
together and sucked away under his hand; moulding the
universe when there is none, and again destroying it when it has
come into being. The opposite principle which we find in the <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
universe, whatever its origin, is that which binds being together
and prevails over the corporeal weakness tending to destruction.
To my thinking the word “EI” is confronted with this false
view, and testifies to the God that <span class='fss'>THOU ART</span>, meaning that no
shift or change has place in him, but that such things belong <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>394<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
to some other God, or rather to some Spirit set over Nature in its
perishing and becoming, whether to effect either process or
to undergo it. This appears from the names, in themselves
opposite and contradictory. He is called Apollo, another is
called Pluto; he is Delius, the other Aidoneus; he is Phoebus,
the other “Skotios”; by his side are the Muses, and Memory,
with the other are Oblivion and Silence; he is Theorius and
Phanaeus, the other is “King of dim Night and ineffectual
Sleep”.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c006'><sup>[78]</sup></a> The other is <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

it trailed along in mourning, nor was its service therein much
esteemed or very cheerful; then there came a general confusion.
It was specially by mingling things which were of Gods with
those which were of daemons that the distinction of the
instruments was lost. Anyhow, the phrase “<span class='fss'>KNOW THYSELF</span>”
seems to stand in a sort of antithesis to the letter “E”, and
yet, again, to accord with it. The letter is an appeal, a cry
raised in awe and worship to the God, as being throughout

nature and of his weakness.’</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Philinus.</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Diogenianus</span>, a young visitor from Pergamum, son of a friend of the same name.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Theon</span>, a literary friend.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Serapion</span>, the Athenian poet.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Boethus</span>, a geometrician, almost a convinced Epicurean.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Two Guides</span> of the temple of Delphi.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>1. <span class='sc'>Philinus</span>, coming out of the temple, explains to <span class='sc'>Basilocles</span>
why his party has been so long in making the round of the sights.
It included an intelligent and inquisitive visitor, the younger
Diogenianus, of Pergamum. He continues:—</p>

<p class='c005'>2. <span class='sc'>Diogenianus</span> raised a point about the tint of the Corinthian
bronze. <span class='sc'>Theon</span> interposed with a story:</p>

<p class='c005'>3. And discussed the properties of olive oil, which produces
a crust on metals. He refers to Aristotle’s view (which cannot
be traced in his extant works).</p>

<p class='c005'>4. He suggested special properties in the air of Delphi—density
and rarity—and quotes Homer for the combination of
such opposites.</p>

<p class='c005'>5. A verse inscription catching the eye of <span class='sc'>Diogenianus</span>
caused him to ask why the verses of oracles are so poor. <span class='sc'>Serapion</span>
suggested that perhaps our standard ought to be revised by that
of the God. <span class='sc'>Boethus</span> told a story about Pauson the painter.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>He added that there is no excuse in the subject-matter, witness
Serapion, who wrote excellent poetry on dry science!</p>

<p class='c005'>6. <span class='sc'>Serapion</span> agreed that our standards are wrong—they lack
severity. Pleasure was cast out, once for all, from the seat of
the Sibyl.</p>

<p class='c005'>7. <span class='sc'>Theon</span> disclaimed the false theory of inspiration. The
verses are not the God’s, he only gives the impulse. But there
is no pleasing the Epicureans, whether the prophetess uses verse
or prose. <span class='sc'>Diogenianus</span> protested against levity on a subject
of profound interest to all Greeks. <span class='sc'>Theon</span> asked that the
question might be reserved, and the round continued.</p>

<p class='c005'>8. Instances from Hiero’s statue, and others, of the jealous
care of Providence for human affairs. <span class='sc'>Boethus</span> thought Chance,
or Spontaneity, sufficient to account for all, and was answered
by <span class='sc'>Philinus</span>, who continued,</p>

<p class='c005'>9. And referred to the history of the first Sibyl. <span class='sc'>Boethus</span>
mocked, and was met by <span class='sc'>Diogenianus</span> with instances of prophecies
verified,</p>

<p class='c005'>10. Which <span class='sc'>Boethus</span> would explain as successful guesses.</p>

<p class='c005'>11. <span class='sc'>Serapion</span> called for a distinction to be made between
prophecies made in general terms, and those which go into
details.</p>

<p class='c005'>12. <span class='sc'>Diogenianus</span> asked the emblematic import of the frogs
on the Corinthian brazen bowl. <span class='sc'>Serapion</span> suggested a reference
to the Sun rising out of water. <span class='sc'>Philinus</span> here detected an
intrusion of the Stoic ‘Conflagration’ into the discussion.
A casual remark raised the question of the identity of the sun
with Phoebus. ‘They are as different’, said <span class='sc'>Diogenianus</span>, ‘as
the sun and the moon, only the sun has permanently eclipsed
the God, the sensible, the spiritual.’</p>

<p class='c005'>13. <span class='sc'>Serapion</span> asked a question which the guides had already
answered: ‘No wonder if they are bewildered by our high-flown
talk.’</p>

<p class='c005'>14. The statue of Rhodope, the courtesan, called forth a
stern protest from <span class='sc'>Diogenianus</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>15. <span class='sc'>Theon</span>, on an appeal from <span class='sc'>Serapion</span>, pointed out the
greater scandal of offerings made by Greeks for victories over
Greeks.</p>

<p class='c005'>16. One of the <span class='sc'>Guides</span> reminded the company of the story of
Croesus and the baker-woman.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>17. <span class='sc'>Diogenianus</span> begged that, instead of more anecdotes,
the original question might be discussed: ‘Why has the use of
verse in oracular answers been discontinued?’ The company
seated itself in a new position, and <span class='sc'>Boethus</span> genially remarked
on its appropriateness, the place of origin of the heroic metre.</p>

<p class='c005'>18. <span class='sc'>Serapion</span> congratulated him on his improved tone, and
<span class='sc'>Philinus</span> agreed. Philosophers have dropped verse, yet we do
not infer that Philosophy has died out. <span class='sc'>Philinus</span> agreed.</p>

<p class='c005'>19-end. <span class='sc'>Theon</span> spoke to the original question.</p>

<p class='c005'>19. He mentioned ancient oracles delivered in prose,</p>

<p class='c005'>20. And modern oracles given in verse.</p>

<p class='c005'>21. To sum up: Soul is the instrument of the God, body of
soul; the result must partake in the infirmity of body. The
cases of reflecting mirrors, and of the moon. Thus there are two
separate emotions in the prophetess—inspiration and Nature.</p>

<p class='c005'>22. Homeric instances of the choice of human instruments—Story
of Battus.</p>

<p class='c005'>23. Of the ancient oracles (1) many were delivered in prose,
(2) the fashion of the times was for verse (cp. c. 18).</p>

<p class='c005'>24. It is better that oracles should be given in current coin,
not in the depreciated coin of verse. History of poetical usage.</p>

<p class='c005'>25. In old times obscurity was thought dignified, now it
provokes impatience; and it has become vulgarized through
charlatans.</p>

<p class='c005'>26. When cities and statesmen used to consult the oracle on
questions of high policy, circumlocution was necessary.</p>

<p class='c005'>27. Again, verse was a great help to memory, when intricate
advice was given, as to Battus.</p>

<p class='c005'>28. In these days of general rest, only homely questions are
asked, and are best answered in homely prose.</p>

<p class='c005'>29. Yet we fear lest the credit acquired in three thousand
years by the straight concise answers of the oracle should be lost!
We gush out with wealth, as the mythical Galaesus with milk.
I am proud to have had some hand in this.</p>

<p class='c005'>30. People who regret the old obscurity and bombast are
like children who admire a rainbow more than the sun which
makes it.</p>

<p class='c012'>In Theon’s long concluding speech (c. 19, p. 403 <span class='fss'>A</span> to the
end) he is no doubt expressing Plutarch’s own views. But the
literary references and the touch of levity are quite in Theon’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>style; ‘my young friend’, in c. 20, recalls the same phrase in c. 3.
Later on, Plutarch is, as Wyttenbach has observed, indicated by τὸν
καθηγεμόνα ταύτης τῆς πολιτείας. Professor Hartman (see Preface,
p. <a href='#Page_xx'>xx</a>) states his conviction that Theon was an older friend of
Plutarch and his predecessor in the priesthood (pp. 166 and 617).
In a Dialogue in which the Epicureans are attacked (<i>Non posse suaviter</i>,
p. 1088 <span class='fss'>D</span>) a long speech clearly belonging to Theon is introduced
by the words ‘I (Plutarch) said’. This slip is probably due
to the author. (See, on the general subject, Mr. John Oakesmith’s
note on p. 149 of The Religion of Plutarch.)</p>
<h3 class='c009'>WHY THE PYTHIA DOES NOT NOW GIVE ORACLES IN VERSE</h3>
<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>394 <span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> <i>Basilocles.</i> The shades of evening, Philinus, while you are
conducting the stranger round the votive gifts! Here am I,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> fairly tired out in waiting for you.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Philinus.</i> Yes, Basilocles, we made slow progress, sowing
arguments as we went and reaping them too; battle and war
were beneath them, as they sprang and sprouted in our faces,
like the ‘sown men’ of old.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Basilocles.</i> Then shall I have to call in some one else of your
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> company, or will you oblige us with the whole story? What
were the arguments, and who were the speakers?</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Philinus.</i> I shall have to do that myself, Basilocles, it seems,
for you will not easily meet with any of the others in the town;
I saw most of them going back to the Corycium and the Lycuria
with the stranger.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Basilocles.</i> A good sight-seer this stranger, and a mighty good
listener!</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Philinus.</i> Say rather a good scholar and a good learner. Not
that these are his most admirable points; there is a gentleness
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>395<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> which is full of charm; and then his readiness to do battle and
to raise sensible points: nothing captious or hard in his way of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>taking the answers. After a very short time in his company
you would have to say ‘good father, good child’, for you know
that Diogenianus was one of the very best.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Basilocles.</i> I never saw him myself, but I have met many who
spoke with warm approval of his talk and his character, and in
just the same terms about this young man. But how did the
argument begin, and what started it?</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <i>Philinus.</i> The guides were going through their lectures,
as prepared, showing no regard for our entreaties that they
would cut short their periods and skip most of the inscriptions.
The stranger was but moderately interested in the form and
workmanship of the different statues; it appears that he has <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
seen many beautiful objects of art. What he did admire was
the lustre on the bronze, unlike rust or deposit, but rather
resembling a coat of deep shining blue, so much so, that it
rather well became the sea-captains, with whom the round had
begun, standing up out of the deep so naively with the true
sea tint. ‘Now was there’, he asked, ‘some receipt of pharmacy
known to the old artists in brass like that method of tempering
swords of which we read? It was forgotten in time, and then
bronze had a truce from works of war. As to the Corinthian
bronze, that came by its beautiful colour accidentally, not
through art. A fire spread over a house in which were stored
some gold and silver and a large quantity of bronze. The
whole was fused into one stream of metal, which took its name <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
from the bronze, as the largest ingredient.’ Theon broke in:
‘We have heard a different story, with a spice of mischief in it.
A Corinthian bronze-worker found a chest containing much
gold. Fearing discovery, he chipped it off little by little, and
quietly mixed the bits with the bronze; the result was a marvellous
blend, which he sold at a high price, as people were delighted
with the beauty of the colour. However, the one story
is as mythical as the other; what we may suppose is that some

they mix gold with silver, and get a peculiar and rare effect,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> which to me appears a sickly pallor and a loss of colour with
no beauty in it.’</p>

<p class='c005'>III. ‘What has been the cause, then,’ said Diogenianus,
‘do you think, of the colour of the bronze here?’ ‘Here is a case’,
said Theon, ‘in which, of the first and most natural elements
which are or ever will be, fire, earth, air, water, none approaches
or touches the bronze, save air only: clearly then, air is the
agent; from its constant presence and contact the bronze gets
its exceptional quality, or perhaps</p>

<p class='c011'>as the comic poet has it; but what you want to learn is the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> nature of air, and the property in virtue of which its repeated
contact has coloured the bronze.’ Diogenianus said that it was.
‘And I too,’ Theon continued, ‘my young friend, let us follow
the quest together; and first, if you will agree, ask why olive
oil produces a more copious rust on the metal than other
liquids; it does not, of course, actually make the deposit, being
pure and uncontaminated when it is applied.’ ‘Certainly not;’
said the young man, ‘the real cause appears to me to be
something different; the oil is fine, pure, and transparent, so
the rust when it meets it is specially evident, whereas with other
liquids it becomes invisible.’ ‘Excellent,’ said Theon, ‘my
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> young friend, that is prettily put. But consider also, if you
please, the cause given by Aristotle.’ ‘I do please’, he said.
‘Aristotle says that the rust, when it comes over other liquids,
passes invisibly through and is dispersed, because the particles
are irregular and fine, whereas in the density of oil it is held up
and permanently condensed. If, then, we can frame some
such hypothesis for ourselves, we shall not be wholly at a loss for
a spell to charm away this difficulty.’</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>IV. We encouraged him and agreed, so he (Theon) went <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>396<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
on to say that the air of Delphi is thick and close of texture, with
a tenseness caused by reflection from the hills and their resistance,
but is also fine and biting, as seems to be proved by the facts
of digestion of food. The tenuity allows it to enter the bronze,
and to scrape up from it much solid rust, which rust again is held
up and compressed, because the density of the air does not allow
it a passage through; but the deposit breaks out, because it is
so copious, and takes on a rich bright colour on the surface.
We applauded this, but the stranger remarked that either
hypothesis alone was sufficient for the argument. ‘The fineness’, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
he went on, ‘will be found to be in contradiction to the
density of which you speak, but there is no necessity to assume
it. The bronze, as it ages, exhales or throws off the rust by its
own inherent action; the density holds together and solidifies
the rust, and makes it apparent because of its quantity.’ Theon
broke in: ‘What is to prevent, Sir, the same thing being both
fine and dense, as silks or fine linen stuffs, of which Homer says</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

<p class='c011'>where he indicates the minute and delicate workmanship of the
fabric by the fact that the oil would not remain, but trickled <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
or glided off, the fineness at once and the density refusing it
a passage. And, again, the scraping up of the rust is not the
only purpose served by the tenuity of the air; it also makes
the colour itself pleasanter to the eye and brighter, it mingles
light and lustre with the blue.’</p>

<p class='c005'>V. Here there was an interval of silence; the guides were
again getting their speeches in hand. A certain oracle given in
verse was mentioned—I think it was one about the reign of
Aegon the Argive—when Diogenianus observed that he had
often been surprised at the badness and common quality of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>verses in which the oracles are delivered. Yet the God is
Choirmaster of the Muses, and eloquent language is no less
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> his function than beauty of ode or tune, and he should have
a voice far above that of Homer and Hesiod in verse. Here
we have most of the oracles saturated with bad taste and
poverty of metre and diction. Then Serapion, the poet, who
was with us from Athens, said: ‘Then do we really believe that
these verses are the God’s, yet venture to say that they fall
behind Homer and Hesiod in beauty? Shall we not rather take
them for all that is best and most beautiful in poetry, and
revise our judgement of them prejudiced by familiarity with
a bad standard?’ Boethus, the geometer—you know the man,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> already on his way to the camp of Epicurus—broke in: ‘Have
you ever heard the story of Pauson the painter?’ ‘Not I’, said
Serapion. ‘Well, it is worth hearing. It appears that he had
contracted to paint a horse rolling, and painted him galloping.
The owner was indignant; so Pauson laughed and turned the
canvas upside down, with the result that the lower parts became
the upper, and there was the horse rolling, not galloping. So
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> it is, Bion tells us, with certain syllogisms when converted.
Thus some will tell us not that the oracles are quite beautiful
because they are the God’s, but that they are not the God’s
because they are bad! That point may be left unsettled. But
that the verses used in the oracles are bad poetry,’ he went on,
‘is made clear also in your judgement, my dear Serapion, is it
not so? For you write poems which are philosophical and severe
as to matter, but in force and grace and diction more like the
work of Homer and Hesiod than the utterances of the Pythia.’</p>

<p class='c005'>VI. Then Serapion: ‘Yes, we are sick, Boethus, sick in ears
and in eyes; luxury and softness have accustomed us to think
things beautiful as they are more sweet, and to call them so.
Soon we shall actually be finding fault with the Pythia because
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>397<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> she does not speak with a more thrilling voice than Glauce the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>singing-girl, or use costly ointments, or put on purple robes to
go down into the sanctuary, or burn on her censer cassia, mastic,
and frankincense, but only bay leaves and barley meal. Do you
not see’, he went on, ‘what grace the songs of Sappho have, how
they charm and soothe the hearers, while the Sibyl “with
raving mouth”, as Heraclitus says, “utters words with no
laughter, no adornment, no spices”,<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c006'><sup>[86]</sup></a> yet makes her voice
carry to ten thousand years, because of the God. And Pindar<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c006'><sup>[87]</sup></a>
tells us that Cadmus heard from the God “right music”, not <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
sweet music, or delicate music, or twittering music. What is
passionless and pure gives no admission to pleasure; she was
cast out in this very place, together with pain,<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c006'><sup>[88]</sup></a> and the most
of her has dribbled away, it seems, into the ears of men.’</p>

<p class='c005'>VII. When Serapion had done, Theon smiled. ‘Serapion’,
he said, ‘has paid his usual tribute to his own proclivities, making
capital out of the turn which the conversation had taken about
pain and pleasure! But for us, Boethus, even if these verses are
inferior to Homer, let us never suppose that the God has composed
them; he only gives the initial impulse according to the
capacity of each prophetess. Why, suppose the answers had <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
to be written, not spoken. I do not think we should suppose
that the letters were made by the God, and find fault with the
calligraphy as below royal standard. The strain is not the
God’s, but the woman’s, and so with the voice and the phrasing
and the metre; he only provides the fantasies, and puts light
into her soul to illuminate the future; for that is what inspiration
is. To put it plainly, there is no escaping you prophets of
Epicurus—yes, you too, Boethus, are drifting that way—you
blame those old prophetesses because they used bad poetry, and
you also blame those of to-day because they speak their answers in <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
prose, and use the first words which come, that they may not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>be overhauled by you for headless, hollow, crop-tailed lines.’
Then Diogenianus: ‘Do not jest, in Heaven’s name, no!
but help us to solve the problem which is common to us all.
There is not a Greek<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c006'><sup>[89]</sup></a> living who is not in search of a rational
account of the fact that the oracle has ceased to use verse, epic
or other.’ Theon interrupted: ‘At the present moment, my
young friend, we seem to be doing a shabby turn by the guides,
taking the bread out of their mouths. Suffer them first to do
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> their office, afterwards you shall discuss in peace whatever you
wish.’</p>

<p class='c005'>VIII. Our round had now brought us in front of the statue
of Hiero, the tyrant. Most of the stories the stranger knew well,
but he good-naturedly lent his ear to them. At last, when he
heard that a certain bronze pillar given by Hiero, which had
been standing upright, fell of its own accord on the very day
when Hiero died at Syracuse, he showed surprise. I set myself
to remember similar instances, such as the notable one of Hiero
the Spartan, how before his death at Leuctra the eyes fell out
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> of his statue, and the gold stars disappeared which Lysander had
dedicated after the naval battle of Aegospotami. Then the
stone statue of Lysander himself broke out into such a growth of
weeds and grass that the face was hidden. At the time of the
Athenian disaster at Syracuse, the golden berries kept dropping
off from the palm trees, and crows chipped the shield on the
figure of Pallas. Again, the crown of the Cnidians, which
Philomelus, tyrant of Phocis, had given to Pharsalia the dancing
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>398<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> girl, caused her death, as she was playing near the temple of
Apollo in Metapontum, after she had removed from Greece into
Italy. The young men made a rush at the crown, and in their
struggle to get it from one another, tore the woman to pieces.
Now Aristotle used to say that no one but Homer made ‘words
which stir, because of their energy’.<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c006'><sup>[90]</sup></a> But I would say that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>there have been votive offerings sent here which have movement
in a high degree, and help the God’s foreknowledge to
signify things; that none of them is void or without feeling, but
all are full of Divinity. ‘Very good!’ said Boethus; ‘so it is not
enough to shut the God into a mortal body once every month.
We will also knead him into every morsel of stone and brass, to <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
show that we do not choose to hold Fortune, or Spontaneity,
a sufficient author of such occurrences.’ ‘Then in your
opinion’, I said, ‘each of the occurrences looks like Fortune or
Spontaneity; and it seems probable to you that the atoms
glided forth, and were dispersed, and swerved, not sooner and
not later, but at the precise moment when each of the dedicators
was to fare worse or better. Epicurus helps you now by what
he said or wrote three hundred years ago; but the God, unless <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
he take and shut himself up in all things, and be mingled with
all, could not, you think, initiate movement, or cause change of
condition in anything which is!’</p>

<p class='c005'>IX. Such was my answer to Boethus, and to the same effect
about the Sibyl and her utterances. For when we stood near
the rock by the Council Chamber, on which the first Sibyl is
said to have been seated on her arrival from Helicon, where she
had been brought up by the Muses (though others say that she
came from the Maleans, and was the daughter of Lamia the
daughter of Poseidon), Serapion remembered the verses in
which she hymned herself; how she will never cease from <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
prophesying, even after death, but will herself go round in the
moon, being turned into what we call the ‘bright face’, while
her breath is mingled with the air and borne about in rumours
and voices for ever and ever; and her body within the earth
suffers change, so that from it spring grass and weeds, the pasture
of sacred cattle, which have all colour, shapes, and qualities in
their inward parts whereby men obtain forecasts of future
things. Here Boethus made his derision still more evident.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The stranger observed that, although these things have a
mythical appearance, yet the prophecies are attested by many
overturnings and removals of Greek cities, inroads of barbarian
hordes, and upsettings of dynasties. ‘These still recent
troubles at Cumae and Dicaearchia<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c006'><sup>[91]</sup></a>, were they not chanted
long ago in the songs of the Sibyl, so that Time was only discharging
his debts in the fires which have burst out of the
mountain, the boiling seas, the masses of burning rocks<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c006'><sup>[92]</sup></a> tossed
aloft by the winds, the ruin of cities many and great, so that if
you visit them in broad daylight you cannot get a clear idea of
the site, the ground being covered with confused ruins? It is
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> hard to believe that such things have happened, much harder
to predict them without divine power.’</p>

<p class='c005'>X. ‘My good Sir,’ said Boethus, ‘what does happen in
Nature which is not Time paying his debts? Of all the strange
unexpected things, by land or sea, among cities and men, is
there any which some one might not foretell, and then, after it
has happened, find himself right? Yet this is hardly foretelling
at all; it is telling, rather it is tossing or scattering words into
the infinite, with no principle in them. They wander about,
often Fortune meets them and throws in with them, but it is
all spontaneous. It is one thing, I think, when what has been
foretold happens, quite another when what will happen is
foretold. Any statement made about things then non-existent
contains intrinsic error, it has no right to await the confirmation
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>399<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> which comes from spontaneous happening; nor is it any true
proof of having foretold with knowledge that the thing happened
after it was foretold, for Infinity brings all things. No,
the “good guesser”, whom the proverb<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c006'><sup>[93]</sup></a> has announced to be the
best prophet, is like a man who hunts on the trail of the future,
by the help of the plausible. These Sibyls and Bacises threw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>into the sea, that is, into time, without having any real clue,
nouns and verbs about troubles and occurrences of every
description. Some of these prophecies came about, but they
were lies; and what is now pronounced is a lie like them, even
if, later on, it should happen to turn out true.’ <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c005'>XI. When Boethus had finished, Serapion spoke: ‘The case
is quite fairly put by Boethus against prophecies so indefinitely
worded as those he mentions, with no basis of circumstance:
“If victory has been foretold to a general, he has conquered.
If the destruction of a city, it is lost.” But where not only
the thing which is to happen is stated, but also the how, the
when, after what event, with whose help, then it is not a guess
at things which will perhaps be, but a clear prediction of things
which will certainly be. Here are the lines<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c006'><sup>[94]</sup></a> with reference to
the lameness of Agesilaus: <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

      <div class='line'><i>And rolling Time his tide of carnage pour.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>And then those about the island<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c006'><sup>[95]</sup></a> which the sea cast up off
Thera and Therasia, and also about Philip and his war with
the Romans:</p>

      <div class='line'><i>The worse shall beat the stronger in the fight.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>What happened within a short time—that the Romans mastered
the Carthaginians, and brought the war with Philip to a finish, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>that Philip met the Aetolians and Romans in battle and was
defeated, and, lastly, that an island rose out of the depths of
the sea, with much fire and boiling waves—could not all be set
down to chance and spontaneous occurrence. Why, the order
emphasizes the foreknowledge, and so does the time predicted
to the Romans, some five hundred years before the event, as that
in which they were to be at war with all the races at once, which
meant the war with the slaves after their revolt. In all this
nothing is unascertainable, the story is not left in dim light to
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> be groped out with reference to Fortune “in Infinity”, it gives
many securities, and is open to trial, it points the road which
the destined event is to tread. For I do not think that any one
will say that the agreement with the details as foretold was
accidental. Otherwise, what prevents some one else from saying
that Epicurus did not write his <i>Leading Principles</i> for our
use, Boethus, but that the letters fell together by chance and
just spontaneously, and so the book was finished off?’</p>

<p class='c005'>XII. While we were talking thus, we were moving forward.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In the store-house of the Corinthians we were looking at the
golden palm tree, the only remnant of their offerings, when the
frogs and water-snakes embossed round the roots caused much
surprise to Diogenianus, and, for the matter of that, to us.
For the palm tree is not, like many others, a marshy or water-loving
plant, nor have frogs anything specially to do with the
Corinthians. Thus they must be a symbolical or canting device
of that city, just as the men of Selinus are said to have dedicated
a golden plant of parsley (selinon), and those of Tenedos
the axe, because of the crabs found round the place which they
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>400<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> call Asterium, the only ones, it appears, with the brand of an
axe on the shell. Yet the God himself is supposed to have
a partiality for crows and swans and wolves and hawks, for anything
rather than beasts like crabs. Serapion observed that
the artist intended a veiled hint at the sun drawing his aliment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>and origin from exhalations out of moist places, whether he had
it from Homer,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'><i>Leaving the beauteous lake, the great sun scaled</i></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>or whether he had seen the sun painted by the Egyptians as
a newly-born child seated on a lotus. I laughed: ‘Where
have you got to again, my good Sir,’ I said, ‘thrusting the <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Porch in here, and quietly slipping into our discussion their
“Conflagrations” and “Exhalations”? Thessalian women fetch
the sun and the moon down to us, but you are assuming that
they are first born and then watered out of earth and its waters.
Plato<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c006'><sup>[97]</sup></a> dubbed man “a heavenly plant”, rearing himself up
from a root on high, namely, his head; but you laugh down
Empedocles when he tells us how the sun, having been brought
into being by reflection of heavenly light around the earth</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Beams back upon Olympus undismayed!</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Yet, on your own showing, the sun is a creature or plant of
the marshes, naturalized by you in the country of frogs or <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
water-snakes. However, all this may be reserved for the Stoics
and their tragedies; here we have the incidental works of the
artists, and let us examine them incidentally. In many respects
they are clever people, but they have not in all cases avoided
coldness and elaboration. Just as the man who designed
Apollo with the cock in his hand meant to suggest the early
morning hour when dawn is coming, so here the frogs may be
taken for a symbol of the spring season when the sun begins to
have power over the air and to break up winter; always supposing <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
that, with you, we are to reckon Apollo and the sun
one God, not two.’ ‘What?’ said Serapion, ‘do you not agree?
Do you hold the sun to be different from Apollo?’ ‘As different
as the moon from the sun;’ I replied, ‘only she does not hide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>the sun often or from all the world,<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c006'><sup>[98]</sup></a> whereas the sun has made,
we may almost say, all the world ignorant of Apollo, diverting
thought by sensation, to the apparent from the real.’</p>

<p class='c005'>XIII. Next Serapion asked the guides the real reason why
they call the chamber not after Cypselus, the Dedicator, but
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> after the Corinthians. When they were silent, being, as
I privately believe, at a loss for a reason, I laughed, and said:
‘What can these men possibly know or remember, utterly dazed
as they must be by our high celestial talk? Why, it was only
just now that we heard them saying that, after the tyranny was
overthrown, the Corinthians wished to inscribe the golden statue
at Pisa, and also this treasure-house, with the name of the city.
So the Delphians granted it as a right, and agreed; but the Corinthians
passed a vote to exclude the Eleians, who had shown jealousy
of them, from the Isthmian meetings, and from that time to
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> this there has been no competitor from Elis. The murder of the
Molionidae by Hercules near Cleonae has nothing to do with the
exclusion of the Eleians, though some think that it has. On the
contrary, it would have been for them to exclude the Corinthians
if that had been the cause of collision.’ Such were my remarks.</p>

<p class='c005'>XIV. When we passed the chamber of the Acanthians and
Brasidas, the guide showed us a place where iron obelisks to
Rhodopis the courtesan once used to stand. Diogenianus
showed annoyance: ‘So it was left for the same state’, he said,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>401<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> ‘to find a place for Rhodopis to deposit the tithes of her earnings,
and to put Aesop, her fellow servant, to death!’ ‘Bless you,
friend,’ said Serapion, ‘why so vexed at that? Carry your eyes
upwards, and behold among the generals and kings the golden
Mnesarete, which Crates called a standing trophy of the lewdness
of the Greeks.’ The young man looked: ‘Was it then
about Phryne that Crates said that?’ ‘Yes, it was,’ said Serapion,
‘her name was Mnesarete, but she took on that of Phryne
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>(toad) as a nickname because of her yellow skin. Many names,
it would seem, are concealed by these nicknames. There was
Polyxena, mother of Alexander, afterwards said to have been
called Myrtale and Olympias and Stratonice. Then Eumetis <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of Rhodes is to this day called by most people Cleobuline, after
her father; and Herophile of Erythrae, when she showed a
prophetic gift, was addressed as Sibylla. You will hear the
grammarians telling us that Leda has been named Mnesinoe,
and Orestes Achaeus. But how do you propose’, he went on,
looking hard at Theon, ‘to get rid of the charge as to Phryne?’</p>

<p class='c005'>XV. Theon smiled quietly: ‘In this way:’ he said, ‘by
a cross charge against you for raking up the pettiest of the <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Greek misdoings. For as Socrates,<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c006'><sup>[99]</sup></a> when entertained in the
house of Callias, makes war upon the ointment only, but looks
on at all the dancing and tumbling and kisses and buffoonery,
and holds his tongue, so you, it seems to me, want to exclude
from the temple a poor woman who made an unworthy use of
her charms; but when you see the God encompassed by first-fruits
and tithes of murders, wars, and raids, and his temple
loaded with Greek spoils and booty, you show no disgust; you
have no pity for the Greeks when you read on the beautiful
offerings such deeply disgraceful inscriptions as “Brasidas and
the Acanthians from the Athenians”, “Athenians from <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Corinthians”, “Phocians from Thessalians”, “Orneatans from
Sicyonians”, “Amphictyones from Phocians”. So Praxiteles,
it seems, was the one person who offended Crates by finding<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c006'><sup>[100]</sup></a>
room for his mistress to stand here, whereas Crates ought
to have commended him for placing beside those golden kings
a golden courtesan, a strong rebuke to wealth as having nothing
wonderful or worshipful about it. It would be good if kings <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and rulers were to set up in the God’s house offerings to Justice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>Temperance, Magnanimity, not to golden and delicate
Abundance, in which the very foulest lives have their share.’</p>

<p class='c005'>XVI. ‘You are forgetting to mention’, said one or other of
the guides, ‘how Croesus had a golden figure of the baker-woman
made, and dedicated it here.’ ‘Yes,’ said Theon, ‘but
that was not to flout the temple with his luxury of wealth, but
for a good and righteous cause. The story is<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c006'><sup>[101]</sup></a> that Alyattes,
father of Croesus, married a second wife, and brought up a fresh
family. This woman made a plot against Croesus; she gave
poison to the baker and told her to knead a loaf with it and serve
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> to Croesus. The baker told Croesus secretly, and set the loaf
before the wife’s children. And so, when Croesus became king,
he requited the baker-woman’s service in a way which made the
God a witness, and moreover did a good turn to him. Hence’,
he said, ‘it is quite proper to honour and love any such offering
from cities as that of the Opuntians. When the Phocian
tyrants had melted up many of the gold and silver offerings and
struck coined money, which they distributed among the cities,
the Opuntians collected all the silver they could find, and sent
a large jar to be consecrated here to the God. I commend the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>402<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Myrinaeans also, and the Apollonians, who sent hither sheaves
of gold, and even more highly the Eretrians and Magnesians,
who endowed the God with firstfruits of men, as being the giver
of crops and also ancestral, racial, humane. Whereas I blame
the Megarians, because they were almost alone in setting up
the God holding a lance; this was after the battle in which they
defeated and expelled the Athenians when holding their city,
after the Persian wars. Later on, however, they offered to him
a golden harp-quill, attaching it, as it appears, to Scythinus,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> who says of the lyre:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in24'><i>which the son of Zeus</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Wears, the comely God Apollo, gathering first and last in one,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>And he holds a golden harp-quill flashing as the very sun.</i>’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>XVII. Serapion wanted to put In some further remark on
this, when the stranger said: ‘It is delightful to listen to such
speeches as we have heard, but I feel myself obliged to claim
fulfilment of the original promise, that we should hear the cause
which has made the Pythia cease to prophesy in epic or other
verse. So, if it be your pleasure, let us leave to another time
the remainder of the sights, sit down where we are, and hear
about that. For it is this more than anything else which militates
against the credibility of the oracle; it must be one of
two things, either the Pythia does not get near the spot where
the Divinity is, or the current is altogether exhausted, and <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the power has failed.’ Accordingly, we went round and seated
ourselves on the southern plinth of the temple, in view of the
temple of Earth and the fountain, which made Boethus at once
observe that the very place where the problem was raised lent
itself to the stranger’s case. For here was a temple of the
Muses where the exhalation rises from the fountain; from which
they drew the water used for the lustrations, as Simonides<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c006'><sup>[102]</sup></a>
has it:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Whence is drawn for holy washings</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Water of the Muses bright.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>And again, in a rather more elaborate strain, the same poet <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
addressing Clio:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Holy patron of our washings, Goddess sought with many a vow,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>By no golden robe encumbered, hear thy servants drawing now</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Water, fragrant and delightful, from ambrosial depths below.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>So Eudoxus was wrong in believing those who have made out
that this was called ‘Water of Styx’. But they installed the
Muses as assessors in prophecy and guardians of the place, by the
fountain and the temple of Earth where the oracle used to be,
because the responses were given in metre and in lyric strains.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>And some say further that the heroic metre was heard for the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> first time here:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Bring in your feathers, ye birds, ye bees, bring wax at his bidding.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The God was in need, and dignity was waived!<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c006'><sup>[103]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>XVIII. ‘More reasonable, that, Boethus,’ said Serapion,
‘and more in tune with the Muses. For we ought not to fight
against the God, nor to remove, along with his prophecy, his
Providence and Godhead also, but rather to seek fresh solutions
for apparent contradictions, and never to surrender the reverent
belief of our fathers.’ ‘Excellent Serapion!’ I said, ‘you
are right. We were not abandoning Philosophy, as cleared out
of the way and done for, because once upon a time philosophers
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> put out their dogmas and theories in verse, as Orpheus, Hesiod,
Parmenides, Empedocles, Thales, whereas later on they gave it
up, and have now all given it up—except you! In your hands
Poetry is returning home to Philosophy, and clear and noble is
the strain in which she rallies our young people. Astronomy
again: she was not lowered in the hands of Aristarchus, Timocharis,
Aristyllus, Hipparchus, all writing in prose, whereas Eudoxus,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>403<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Hesiod, and Thales used metre, if we assume that Thales really
wrote the <i>Astronomy</i> attributed to him. Pindar actually expresses
surprise at the neglect, in his own day, of a mode of
melody....<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c006'><sup>[104]</sup></a> There is nothing out of the way or absurd in
seeking out the causes of such changes; but to remove arts and
faculties altogether, whenever there is disturbance or variation
in their details, is not fair.’</p>

<p class='c005'>XIX. ‘And yet’, interposed Theon, ‘those instances have
involved really great variations and novelties, whereas of the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> oracles given here we know of many in prose even in old days,
and those on no trifling matters. When the Lacedaemonians,
as Thucydides<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c006'><sup>[105]</sup></a> has told us in his history, consulted the God about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>their war with the Athenians, he promised them victory and
mastery, and that “he himself will help them, invited or
uninvited.” And again, that, if they did not restore Pleistoanax<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c006'><sup>[106]</sup></a>,
they shall plough with a silver share.<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c006'><sup>[107]</sup></a> When the
Athenians consulted him about their expedition in Sicily, he
directed them to bring the priestess of Erythrae to Athens; now
the woman’s name was Peace. When Deinomenes the Siceliot
inquired about his sons, the answer was that all three should <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
reign as tyrants. “And the worse for them, O Master Apollo”,
rejoined Deinomenes. “That too”, added the God, “to form
part of the answer.” You know that Gelo had the dropsy and
Hiero the stone, while they reigned; Thrasybulus, the third,
was involved in revolutions and wars and soon lost his throne.
Then Procles, tyrant of Epidaurus, after putting many others
to death in cruel and unlawful ways, at last killed Timarchus,
who had come to him from Athens with money, after receiving
him with hospitality and kindness; he thrust his body into
a crate and flung it out to sea. This he did by the hands of
Cleander of Aegina, no one else knew. Afterwards, when <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
himself in trouble, he sent his brother Cleotimus, to consult the
oracle secretly about his own exile and retirement. The God
answered that he granted exile to Procles, and retirement either
to the place where he had ordered his Aeginetan friend to lodge
the crate, or where the stag sheds his horn. The tyrant understood
the God to bid him fling himself into the sea, or bury himself
underground (for the stag buries his horn deep out of sight,
when it falls off). He waited a short time, then, when his affairs
became desperate, went into exile. But the friends of Timarchus
caught and slew him, and cast out the corpse into the sea. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Now comes the strongest instance: the statutes by which
Lycurgus regulated the Lacedaemonian constitution were given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>to him in prose. So Alyrius, Herodotus, Philochorus, and Ister,
the men who most zealously set about collecting metrical prophecies,
have written down oracular responses which were not in
metre, and Theopompus, who was exceptionally interested
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> about the oracle, has administered a vigorous rebuke to those
who do not hold that the Pythia prophesied in metre in those
days; yet, when he wanted to prove the point, he has found an
exceedingly small number of such answers, which shows that the
others, even at that early time, were put forth in prose.</p>

<p class='c005'>XX. ‘Some oracles, however, still run into metres, one of
which has made “necessary business”<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c006'><sup>[108]</sup></a> a household word.
There is in Phocis a temple of “Hercules Woman-Hater”, where
the practice is for the consecrated priest not to associate with
a woman during his year. So they appoint comparatively old
men to the priesthood. However, not very long ago, a young
man of good character, but ambitious, who was in love with
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>404<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> a girl, accepted the office. At first he put constraint on himself
and avoided her; but one day, when he was resting after wine
and dancing, she burst in, and he yielded. Then, in his fear
and confusion, he fled to the oracle, and proceeded to ask the
God about his offence, and whether it admitted of excuse or
expiation. He received this reply:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>All needful business doth the God allow.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>All the same, if it be granted that nothing is prophesied in our
own day, otherwise than in metre, the difficulty will be so much
greater about the ancients, who sometimes employed metre for
the responses, sometimes not. There is nothing strange, my
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> young friend, in either one or the other, so long as we hold sound,
pure views about the God, and do not suppose that it is himself
who formerly used to compose the verses, or who now suggests
the answers to the Pythia, speaking as it were from under a mask.</p>

<p class='c005'>XXI. ‘However, it is worth our while to pursue this inquiry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>at greater length another time. For the present, let us remember
our results, which are briefly these: Body uses many instruments,
soul uses body and its parts, soul has been brought into
being as the instrument of God. The excellence of an instrument
is to imitate most closely the power which uses it, with all its <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
own natural power, and to reproduce the effect of his essential
thought, but to exhibit it, not pure and passionless and free from
error, as it was in the creative artist, but with a large admixture
of foreign element. For in itself it is invisible to us, but appearing
“other” and through another medium it is saturated with
the nature of that medium. I pass over wax and gold and silver
and copper, and all other varieties of moulded substance, which
take on one common form of impressed likeness, but add to the
copy, each its own distinct speciality. I pass over the myriad
distortions of images and reflections from a single form in <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
mirrors, plane, hollow, or convex. For nothing seems better
to reproduce the type, no instrument more obediently to use
its own nature, than the moon. Yet taking from the sun his
bright and fiery rays, she does not transmit them so to us;
mingled with herself they change colour and also take on a
different power; the heat has wholly disappeared, and the light
fails from weakness before it reaches us. I think you know the
saying found in Heraclitus, that “The King whose seat is at <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Delphi, speaks not, nor conceals, but signifies.”<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c006'><sup>[109]</sup></a> Take and
add then to what is here so well said, the conception that the
God of this place employs the Pythia for the hearing as the sun
employs the moon for the seeing. He shows and reveals his
own thoughts, but shows them mingled in their passage through
a mortal body, and a soul which cannot remain at rest or present
itself to the exciting power unexcited and inwardly composed,
but which boils and surges and is involved in the stirrings and
troublesome passions from within. As whirlpools do not keep <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>a steady hold on bodies borne round and round and also downwards,
since an outer force carries them round, but they sink
down of their own nature, so that there is a compound spiral
movement, of a confused and distorted kind, even so what we
call inspiration seems to be a mixture of two impulses, and the
soul is stirred by two forces, one of which it is a passive recipient,
one from its own nature. We see that inanimate and stationary
bodies cannot be used or forced contrary to their own nature,
that a cylinder cannot be moved as if it were a sphere or a cube,
that a lyre cannot be played like a flute or a trumpet like a harp,
but that the artistic use of a thing is no other than the natural
use. Is it possible then that the animate and self-moving, which
has both impulse and reason, can be treated in any other way
than is agreeable to the habit, force, or natural condition which
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>405<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> is already existent within it? Can an unmusical mind be excited
like a musical, an unlettered mind by literature, a mind untrained
in reasoning, whether speculative or disciplinary, by
logic? It is not to be spoken of.</p>

<p class='c005'>XXII. ‘Again, Homer is my witness: he assumes<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c006'><sup>[110]</sup></a> that
nothing, so to speak, is brought about without a God; he does
not, however, describe the God as using all things for all ends,
but according to the art or faculty which each possesses. For do
you not see, dear Diogenianus, that Athena, when she wants to
persuade the Achaeans, calls in Odysseus;<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c006'><sup>[111]</sup></a> when to wreck the
truce, she looks for Pandarus;<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c006'><sup>[112]</sup></a> when to rout the Trojans, she
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> approaches Diomede?<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c006'><sup>[113]</sup></a> Why? because Diomede is a sturdy
man and a fighter, Pandarus an archer and a fool, Odysseus a
clever speaker and a sensible man. For Homer was not of the
same mind as Pindar<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c006'><sup>[114]</sup></a>, if Pindar it was who wrote</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Sail on a crate, if God so choose ‘twill swim.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>He knew that different faculties and natural gifts are appointed
for different ends; each is moved in its own way, even if the
moving force be one for all. As then the force cannot move
that which walks so as to make it fly, nor that which lisps to
speak clearly, nor the thin voice to be melodious—why, Battus
himself was sent as colonist of Libya to get his voice, because he
was a lisper, with a thin voice, but withal a kingly, statesman-like, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
prudent man—, even so it is impossible for one who has no
letters and knows no verse to talk like a poet. And so she who
now serves the God has been born as respectably as any man
here, and has lived as good and orderly a life; but having been
reared in the house of small farmer folk, she brings nothing with
her from art or from any practice or faculty whatsoever, as she
goes down into the sanctuary. As Xenophon<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c006'><sup>[115]</sup></a> thinks that the
bride should step into her husband’s home having seen as little
as may be, and heard as little, so she, ignorant and untried in
almost all things, and a true virgin in soul, is associated with <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the God. Yet we, who think that the God, when he “signifies”,
uses the cries of herons and wrens and ravens, and never ask that
they, as the messengers and heralds of the God, should put
things into clear rational phrases, do nevertheless ask that the
Pythia should use a voice and style as though from the Thymele,
not unembellished and plain, but with metre and elevation, and
trills, and verbal metaphors, and a flute accompaniment!</p>

<p class='c005'>XXIII. ‘What shall we say then about her older predecessors?
Not one thing, I think, but several. In the first place, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
as has been already said, they, too, for the most part, used to give
the responses in prose. In the second place, those times produced
temperaments and natural conditions which offered an easy and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>convenient channel for the stream of poetry, to which were at
once superadded, in one and another, an eagerness, an impulse,
a preparation of soul, all resulting in a readiness which needed
but a slight initial movement from without to give the imagination
a turn. So it was that not only were astronomers and
philosophers drawn, as Philinus says, in their several directions,
but also, when men were mellow with wine and sentiment,
some undercurrent of pity or joy would come, and they would
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> glide into a song-like voice; drinking parties were filled with
amorous strains and songs, books with poems in writing. When
Euripides wrote:<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c006'><sup>[116]</sup></a></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line in18'><i>Love can teach, he makes</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>A poet of a stranger to the Muse</i>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>he did not mean that Love implants a faculty for poetry or
music; the faculty is there already, but Love stirs and warms
what was latent and idle. Or are we to say, Sir Stranger, that
no one now loves, that Love has gone by the heels, because there
is none who, to quote Pindar,<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c006'><sup>[117]</sup></a></p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>406<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> That is absurd. Loves there are and many of them, and they
master men; but when they associate with souls which have
no natural turn for music, they drop the flute and the lyre, yet
are vocal still and fiery through and through, as much as of old.
It is an unhallowed thing to say, and an unfair, that the Academy
was loveless, or the choir of Socrates and Plato; yet, while we
have their love dialogues to read, they have left no poems.
Why not declare at once that Sappho was the only woman who
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> ever loved, if you are to say that Sibylla alone had the gift of
prophecy, or Aristonica, and the others who delivered themselves
in verse? Wine, as Chaeremon<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c006'><sup>[118]</sup></a> used to say,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>

      <div class='line'><i>Is mingled with the moods of them that drink</i>,</div>
    </div>

</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>and the prophetic inspiration, like that of love, uses the faculty
which is subjected to it, and stirs its recipients according to the
nature of each.</p>

<p class='c005'>XXIV. ‘Not but that, if we look also into the subject of
the God and his foreknowledge, we shall see that the change
has taken place for the better. For the use of language is like
exchange in coined money. Here also it is familiarity which
gives currency, the purchasing power varies with the times.
There was a day when metres, tunes, odes were the coins of
language in use; all History and Philosophy, in a word, every <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
feeling and action which called for a more solemn utterance,
were drawn to poetry and music. It is not only that now but
few understand, and they with effort, whereas then all the world
were listeners, and all felt pleasure in what was sung,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in36'><i>who fats his flock,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Who ploughs the soil, who snares the wingèd game</i>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>as Pindar<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c006'><sup>[119]</sup></a> has it. More than that, there was an aptitude for
poetry, most men used the lyre and the ode to rebuke, to encourage,
to frame myths and proverbs; also hymns to the
Gods, prayers, thanksgivings, were composed in metre and song,
as genius or practice enabled them to do. And so it was with
prophecy; the God did not grudge it ornament and grace, or
drive from hence into disgrace the honoured Muse of the tripod; <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
he rather led her on, awakening and welcoming poetic natures;
he gave them visions from himself, he lent his aid to draw out
pomp and eloquence as being fitting and admirable things.
Then there was a change in human life, affecting men both in
fortune and in genius. Expediency banished what was superfluous,
top-knots of gold were dropped, rich robes discarded;
probably too clustering curls were shorn off, and the buskin
discontinued. It was not a bad training, to set the beauty of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> frugality against that of profusion, to account what was plain
and simple a better ornament than the pompous and elaborate.
So it was with language, it changed with the times, and shared
the general break-up. History got down from its coach, and
dropped metre. Truth was best sifted out from Myth in
prose; Philosophy welcomed clearness, and found it better to
instruct than to astonish, so she pursued her inquiry in plain
language. The God made the Pythia leave off calling her own
fellow townsmen “fire-burners”, the Spartans “serpent-eaters”,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> men “mountaineers”, rivers “mountain-drainers”.
He cleared the oracles of epic verses, unusual words, circumlocutions,
and vagueness, and so prepared the way to converse with
his consultants just as laws converse with states, as kings address
subjects, as disciples hear their masters speak, so framing language
as to be intelligible and convincing.</p>

<p class='c005'>XXV. ‘For it should be clearly understood that the God
is, in the words of Sophocles,<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c006'><sup>[120]</sup></a></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Unto the wise a riddling prophet aye,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>To silly souls a teacher plain and brief.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>407<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The same turn of things which brought clearness brought also
a new standard of belief; it shared the general change. Whereas
of old that which was not familiar or common, but, in plain
words, contorted and over-phrased, was ascribed by the many
to an implied Divinity, and received with awe and reverence;
in later times men were content to learn things clearly and easily
with no pomp or artifice; they began to find fault with the
poetical setting of the oracles, not only as a hindrance to the
perception of truth, because it mingled indistinctness and
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> shadow with the meaning, but also because by this time they
were getting to mistrust metaphors, riddles, and ambiguities, as
so many holes or hiding-places provided for him who should trip
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>in his prophecy, that he might step into them and secure his
retreat. You might have heard it told by many, how certain
persons with a turn for poetry still sit about the place of
oracles, waiting to catch the utterances, and then weaving
verses, metres, rhythms, according to occasion, as a sort of
vehicle. As to your Onomacrituses, and Herodotuses, and
Cinaethons,<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c006'><sup>[121]</sup></a> and the censures which they brought upon the
oracles, by importing tragedy and pomp where they were out
of place, I let the charge pass, and do not admit it. Most, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
however, of the discredit which attached so copiously to poetry
came from the gang of soothsayers and scamps who strolled
around the ceremonies of the Great Mother and of Serapis,
with their mummeries and tricks, turning verses out of their
own heads, or taking them at random from handbooks, for
servant boys and silly girls, such as are best attracted by metre
and a poetic cast of words; from all which causes poetry seemed
to put herself at the service of cheats, and jugglers, and lying
prophets, and was lost to truth and to the tripod.</p>

<p class='c005'>XXVI. ‘Thus I should not be surprised to find that the
old people sometimes required a certain ambiguity, circumlocution, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
indistinctness. For it was not then a case of “A”
approaching the oracle with a question, if you please, about the
purchase of a slave, or “B” about business; powerful states,
haughty kings and tyrants, would consult the God on public
affairs, men whom it did not answer the officials of his temple
to vex and provoke by letting them hear what they did not wish
to hear. For the God does not obey Euripides,<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c006'><sup>[122]</sup></a> who sets up as
a lawgiver with</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'><i>Phoebus, none but he,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>May give men prophecies.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He uses mortal men as ministers and prophets, whom it is his
duty to make his care, and to protect, lest they perish at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>hands of the bad while serving him. He does not then choose
to conceal the truth; what he used to do was to give a twist to
its manifestation, which, like a beam of light, is refracted more
than once in its passage, and is parted into many rays as it
becomes poetry, and so to remove whatever in it was harsh and
hard. Tyrants might thus be left in ignorance, and enemies
not be forewarned. For them he threw a veil in the innuendoes
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> and ambiguities which hid the meaning from others,
but did not elude the intelligence of the actual consultants
who gave their whole mind to the answers. Hence, now that
things have changed, it is sheer folly to criticize and find fault
with the God, because he thinks right to give his aid no longer in
the same manner but in another.</p>

<p class='c005'>XXVII. ‘Another thing is this: Language receives no
greater advantage from a poetical form than this, that a meaning
which is wrapped and bound in metre is more easily remembered
and grasped. Now in those days much memory was required.
Many things used to be explained orally; local indications, the
times when things were to be done, rites of Gods across the seas,
secret burying-places of heroes, hard to be discovered by those
setting off for lands far from Greece. You know about Chius
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>408<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> and Cretinus, and Nesichus, and Phalanthus, and many other
leaders of expeditions, how many clues they needed to find the
proper place appointed to each for settlement, while some of
them missed the way, as did Battus.<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c006'><sup>[123]</sup></a> He thought that he
would be turned out, not understanding what the place was
to which he had been sent; then he came a second time loudly
complaining. Then the God answered:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Thou that hast never been there, if thou know’st Libya the sheepland</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Better than I that have been, then wonderful wise is thy wisdom.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>So he sent him out again. Then Lysander entirely failed to
make out the hill Orchalides,<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c006'><sup>[124]</sup></a> otherwise called Alopecus, and
the river Hoplites,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Also the dragon, earthborn, in craftiness coming behind thee</i>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>and was defeated in battle and slain in those very spots by <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Neochorus, a man of Haliartus, who bore a shield with the
device of a serpent. There are many such answers given to the
old people, all hard to grasp and remember, which I need not
give you at length, since you know them.</p>

<p class='c005'>XXVIII. ‘Our present settled condition, out of which the
questions now put to the God arise, I welcome and accept.
There is great peace and tranquillity, war has been made to
cease, there are no wanderings in exile, no revolutions, no
tyrannies, no other plagues or ills in Greece asking for potent
and extraordinary remedies. But when there is nothing complicated
or mysterious, or dangerous, only questions on petty <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
popular matters, like school themes, “whether I should marry”,
“whether I should sail”, “whether I should lend”, and the most
serious responses given to states are concerning harvests and
cattle-breeding and public health, to clothe these in metre, to
devise circumlocutions, to introduce strange words on questions
calling for a plain, concise answer, is what an ambitious sophist
might do, bedizening the oracle for his own glory. But the
Pythia is a lady in herself, and when she descends thither and
is in the presence of the God, she cares for truth rather than for <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
glory, or for the praise or blame of men.</p>

<p class='c005'>XXIX. ‘So perhaps ought we too to feel. As it is, in a sort
of agony of fear, lest the place should lose its reputation of three
thousand years, and a few persons should think lightly of it and
cease to visit the oracle, for all the world as if it were a sophist’s
school, we apologize, and make up reasons and theories about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>things which we neither know nor ought to know. We smooth
the critic down, and try to persuade him, whereas we ought to
bid him be gone—</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>He shall first suffer in a loss not light</i>—<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c006'><sup>[125]</sup></a></div>

</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> if that is the view which he takes of the God. Thus, while you
welcome and admire what the Wise Men of old have written up:
“Know thyself”, and “Nothing too much”, not least because
of the brevity which includes in a small compass a close hammer-beaten
sense, you blame the oracles because they mostly use
concise, plain, direct phrases. It is with sayings like those of
the Wise Men as with streams compressed into a narrow channel;
there is no distinctness or transparency to the eye of the mind,
but if you look into what has been written or said about them
by those who have wished to learn the full meaning of each, you
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> will not easily find longer treatises elsewhere. The language
of the Pythia illustrates what mathematicians mean by calling
a straight line the shortest between the same points; it makes
no bending, or curve, or doubling or ambiguity; it lies straight
towards truth, it takes risks,<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c006'><sup>[126]</sup></a> its good faith is open to examination,
and it has never yet been found wrong; it has filled the shrine
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>409<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> with offerings from Barbarians and Greeks, and has beautified it
with noble buildings and Amphictyonic fittings. Why, you see
for yourselves many buildings added which were not here formerly,
many restored which were ruinous or destroyed. As
new trees spring up by the side of those in vigorous bearing, so
the Pylaea flourishes together with Delphi and is fed upon the
same meat; the plenty of the one causes the other to take on
shapeliness and figure and a beauty of temples, and halls of
meeting and fountains of water, such as it never had in the
thousand years before. Now those who dwell about Galaxius
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> in Boeotia felt the manifest presence of the God in the abundance
and more than abundance of milk:</p>

<p class='c011'>But to us he gives tokens brighter and stronger and more evident
than these, in having, after the days of drought, of desertion

True, I am well pleased with myself for anything which my own <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
zeal or service may have contributed to this result in support of
Polycrates and Petraeus, well pleased too with him who has been
our leader in this policy, to whose thought and planning most
of the improvements are due; but it is wholly impossible that
so great, so vast a change could have been effected in this short
time by merely human care, with no God present here or lending
his Divinity to the place of the oracle.</p>

<p class='c005'>XXX. ‘But as in those days there were some who found
fault with the responses for obliquity and want of clearness, so
now there are those who criticize them as too simple, which is
childishness indeed and rank stupidity! For as children show
more glee and satisfaction at the sight of rainbows or haloes or
comets than in that of the sun or of the moon, so do these <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
people regret the riddles, allegories, and metaphors which are
so many modes of refraction of prophetic art in a mortal and
fanciful medium. And if they do not fully inquire into the cause
of the change, they go away having passed judgement against
the God, rather than against ourselves or themselves, for having
a power of thought which is too feeble to attain to his counsels.’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Time</span>: A little before the Pythian games of Callistratus’ year, perhaps
<span class='fss'>A. D.</span> 83-4.</p>

<p class='c005'>1 and 2. <span class='sc'>Cleombrotus</span> mentions the undying lamp flame at
Ammon, said to require less oil each year, a proof that the years
are growing shorter.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. <span class='sc'>Demetrius</span> thinks the cause inadequate and <span class='sc'>Cleombrotus</span>
mentions other instances of important phenomena due to
insignificant causes.</p>

<p class='c005'>4. <span class='sc'>Ammonius</span> points out that all the heavenly bodies are involved
in the hypothesis, and suggests other causes, as changes
in temperature or in the quality of the oil.</p>

<p class='c005'>5. <span class='sc'>Lamprias</span> invites Cleombrotus to tell the company about
the oracle of Ammon. <span class='sc'>Demetrius</span> suggests, as a subject nearer
home, the failure of the oracles in Boeotia (except those in the
neighbourhood of Lebadeia).</p>

<p class='c005'>6. We were passing out of the temple, and were near the Hall
of the Cnidians, where <span class='sc'>Heracleon</span> and our other friends were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>waiting for us, in silence. On a request from <span class='sc'>Demetrius</span> they
agree to join in our discussion.</p>

<p class='c005'>7. <span class='sc'>Didymus</span> the Cynic (‘Planetiades’) makes an angry protest:
the wonder being that Providence itself had not deserted this
bad world long ago. Heracleon and <span class='sc'>Lamprias</span> humour him,
and he leaves the place quietly.</p>

<p class='c005'>8. <span class='sc'>Ammonius</span> addresses Lamprias: ‘I too deprecate the tone
of Didymus. Still we may recognize other causes, besides
providential action, for the cessation of the oracles, e.g. the
depopulation of Greece and specially of Boeotia.’</p>

<p class='c005'>9. <span class='sc'>Lamprias</span>: ‘We may believe in Gods, yet hold that their
works may be interrupted by specific causes. It is not necessary
that the God should personally operate in his oracles.’</p>

<p class='c005'>10. <span class='sc'>Cleombrotus</span> agreed, but observed that the hypothesis
was much relieved by assuming the existence of daemons, a
middle order between Gods and men, and not immortal,</p>

<p class='c005'>11. But long-lived—say 9,720 years (as Hesiod)—‘What?’
interrupted <span class='sc'>Demetrius</span>; ‘Hesiod was leading up to the Stoic
“Conflagration”!’</p>

<p class='c005'>12. <span class='sc'>Cleombrotus</span> refuses to split straws as to the duration of
a daemon’s life; the point is that there are such things as
daemons.</p>

<p class='c005'>13. The daemons have been compared (by Xenocrates) to an
isosceles triangle (Gods to an equilateral, men to a scalene).
Or again to the moon, which is half earth, half star.</p>

<p class='c005'>14. Instances of daemonic rites,</p>

<p class='c005'>15. And daemonic stories, wrongly attributed to Gods, as
that of Delphi (<span class='sc'>Philippus</span> shows surprise) and the flight of
Apollo.</p>

<p class='c005'>16. <span class='sc'>Heracleon</span> (first addressing <span class='sc'>Philippus</span>) allows that
daemons, not Gods, may be concerned with oracles, but then
they must be sinless beings—<span class='sc'>Cleombrotus</span>: “Sinless daemons—if
so, they would no longer be daemons”:</p>

<p class='c005'>17. And quotes stories to prove that daemons may be faulty,
and one as to the death of Pan to prove that they may be
mortal.</p>

<p class='c005'>18. <span class='sc'>Demetrius</span> confirms this from his experiences in and
about Britain.</p>

<p class='c005'>19. <span class='sc'>Cleombrotus</span> compares the Stoic view of Gods who are
perishable with the Epicurean ‘Infinity’.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>20. <span class='sc'>Ammonius</span> defends Empedocles’ view of faulty daemons
against the Epicureans, who held that, if faulty, they must be
short-lived. As the Epicureans are not represented, he calls
on Cleombrotus to continue his argument for the migration of
daemons.</p>

<p class='c005'>21. <span class='sc'>Cleombrotus</span>, first referring to Plato, has a story of an
oriental recluse, whom he had met about the Red Sea. He
knew all the Delphi legend, and referred it to the struggles of
daemons, who took on the names of the Gods to whom they were
severally attached.</p>

<p class='c005'>22. ‘But how does Plato come in?’ asked <span class='sc'>Heracleon</span>.
‘Because’, replied <span class='sc'>Cleombrotus</span>, ‘Plato allowed a possibility of
more worlds than one, up to five; the recluse asserted (giving
no proof) that there were exactly one hundred and eighty-three
worlds.’</p>

<p class='c005'>23. ‘The impostor!’ says <span class='sc'>Lamprias</span>; ‘that view is purely
Greek, and was put into a book by one Petron of Himera long
ago.’ <span class='sc'>Heracleon</span> and <span class='sc'>Demetrius</span> exchange remarks about
Plato’s views on a plurality of worlds, and agree to refer the
matter to <span class='sc'>Lamprias</span>, who offers to give a cursory account, the
discussion then to revert to the original question.</p>

<p class='c005'>[24-end. Lamprias is the speaker, with an interposition by
Ammonius in c. 33 and again in c. 46, and by Demetrius, who
answers a question in c. 45, and some shorter ones.]</p>

<p class='c005'>24. <span class='sc'>Lamprias</span> <i>loq.</i>: It is <i>a priori</i> likely that this world is not
a sole creation.</p>

<p class='c005'>25. There need be no fear of interference from outside, of

matter stated,</p>

<p class='c005'>26. And considered.</p>

<p class='c005'>29. The Stoic difficulty as to Zeus or Providence in the plural
met. Why not a choir of such powers, free to range from part
to part of the universe?</p>

<p class='c005'>30. Such a view of deities sociable and free to communicate
with each other is the grander one.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>31. (<span class='sc'>Philippus</span> asks to have the bearing of the number five
and the five solid figures on Plato’s scheme explained.)</p>

<p class='c005'>32. <span class='sc'>Lamprias</span>: The matter is thus explained by Theodorus
of Soli:<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c006'><sup>[128]</sup></a> There are five and no more solid figures having all
the faces and all the solid angles in each equal. These are—</p>

<p class='c005'>(<i>a</i>) The Pyramid (Tetrahedron) with four faces, each an
equilateral triangle, and four solid angles,</p>

<p class='c005'>(<i>b</i>) The Cube, six faces, each a square, and eight solid angles,</p>

<p class='c005'>(<i>c</i>) The Octahedron, eight faces, each an equilateral triangle,
and six solid angles,</p>

<p class='c005'>(<i>d</i>) The Dodecahedron, twelve faces, each a regular pentagon,
and twenty solid angles,</p>

<p class='c005'>(<i>e</i>) The Eicosahedron, twenty faces, each an equilateral
triangle, and twelve solid angles.</p>

<p class='c005'>[It follows that (<i>d</i>) having more, and blunter, solid angles
than any, most nearly approximates to the Sphere. (And, in
fact, if the content of the Sphere be 100, that of (<i>d</i>) is 66·5, that
of (<i>e</i>) only 60·5, that of (<i>c</i>) 36·75, and so on). Plato (<i>Timaeus</i>,
pp. 53-5, where see Archer-Hind) shows that each equilateral
triangle may easily be broken into six ‘primary scalenes’, i. e.
triangles with angles 90°, 60°, 30°, which again will reproduce
themselves <i>ad infinitum</i> (Euclid, 6, 8). Hence, if a universe be
constructed out of (<i>a</i>) or (<i>c</i>) or (<i>e</i>) or their plane faces, or of all of
these, it can, in case of dissolution, be reconstructed. This does not
apply to the Cube, the faces of which, however, yield isosceles right-angled
triangles, also available as ‘constituents’ in infinite number,
nor yet to (<i>d</i>) which is therefore reserved for another purpose,
as to which see Burnet (<i>Early Greek Philosophers</i>, c. 7, sect. 148).]</p>

<p class='c005'>The solid figures may be used to construct five different
worlds, or omitting (<i>d</i>) for the four ‘elements’ (fire, &amp;c.).</p>

<p class='c005'>33. <span class='sc'>Ammonius</span> criticizes; he points out that the difficulty
about the figure (<i>d</i>) has been ignored.</p>

<p class='c005'>34. <span class='sc'>Lamprias</span> drops the subject for the present, and turns to
the five categories of being in the <i>Sophistes</i> and <i>Philebus</i>. It is
reasonable to assume that the physical universe may correspond.</p>

here.</p>

<p class='c005'>38. <span class='sc'>Lamprias</span> is invited to return to the original question, as
to the oracles and the migration of daemons.</p>

<p class='c005'>39. <span class='sc'>Lamprias</span> resumes:</p>

<p class='c005'>Why should the prophetic gift be associated with daemons,
i.e. souls which have left the body, rather than with those still in
the flesh, though it may be more energetic after death? Compare

<p class='c005'>43. The local prophetic currents may shift their place about,
as rivers and lakes are known to do.</p>

<p class='c005'>44. Physical commotions, especially earthquakes, may be
expected to cause such shiftings.</p>

<p class='c005'>45. <span class='sc'>Demetrius</span> has been too long away from home to answer
as to the Cydnus, but he tells a story about the oracle of Mopsus,
which had convinced a sceptical magistrate.</p>

<p class='c005'>46. <span class='sc'>Ammonius</span> and <span class='sc'>Philippus</span> have points to raise. That of
the latter is as to the identity of the sun with Apollo, and is
allowed to stand over. <span class='sc'>Ammonius</span> protests against the ascription
of all prophecy to material causes, but wishes to hear the
view of <span class='sc'>Lamprias</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>47. <span class='sc'>Lamprias</span> observes that Plato had made a similar protest
against Anaxagoras. <i>Both</i> sets of causes must be recognized.</p>

<p class='c005'>48. And so in the case of prophetic utterances.</p>

<p class='c005'>49. The actual procedure of Delphi, and the tests applied to
the victim, justified.</p>

or swans, in flight from the extremities of earth to its middle <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
point, met at Delphi near the Navel, as we call it; that later
on Epimenides of Phaestus came to examine into the story
in the God’s house, and, receiving an indistinct and ambiguous
response, wrote</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>No central boss there is of land or sea,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>The Gods may know one, but from man ’tis hid.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>As for the inquirer, he was properly punished by the God for
putting an old story to the proof as though fingering a picture. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>410<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c005'>II. However, shortly before the Pythian games of Callistratus’
year, it happened that two holy men, travelling from
opposite ends of the inhabited globe, met at Delphi; Demetrius
the grammarian, on his homeward voyage from Britain to
Tarsus, and Cleombrotus the Lacedaemonian, who had wandered
much in Egypt and about the land of the Troglodytes, and had
sailed far up the Red Sea, not for commerce, but because
he loved sights and information. Possessing a competence,
and being indifferent to having more, he would use his leisure <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
in such ways, putting together facts as material for a Philosophy
which was to end in what he himself called Theology. Having
lately been at the temple of Ammon, he made it clear that
he was far from admiring its general arrangements, but he told
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>us a story worthy of serious interest as related by the priests,
about the lamp which is never extinguished. They say that it
consumes less oil each successive year, and claim this as a proof
of an inequality in the years which makes each less in duration
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> than its predecessor. Of course, the shorter the period the
less the consumption.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. All present found this wonderful, and Demetrius
observed that it was quite absurd to hunt out such great results
from trifles; not, as Alcaeus puts it, to take the claw and paint
the lion from it, but with a wick and a lamp to shift the whole
order of the heavens, and make a clean sweep of Mathematics.
‘Nothing of that sort will disturb those gentlemen;’ said
Cleombrotus, ‘they will never give in to the mathematicians
on the point of accuracy; they would think it easier for them
to be wrong in their time about movements and periods so
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> very remote, than for themselves to be wrong in measuring
the oil, when they had their attention jealously fixed all the
time on so strange a phenomenon. Besides, Demetrius, not to
allow small things as indications of great ones would be to stop
the way against many arts; many proofs will be put out of
account, and many predictions. Yet you grammarians prove a
fact of no less importance than that the heroes of old shaved with
the razor, because you meet with the word “razor” in Homer,<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c006'><sup>[129]</sup></a>
and again, that they lent money at interest, because he has</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Since of a debt there owing I have need,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Long-standing and not small</i>,<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c006'><sup>[130]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>where the word for “to owe” imports increase! Again, when
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> he calls night “swift”,<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c006'><sup>[131]</sup></a> you fasten lovingly on the word, and
actually say that it implies that the shadow is conical, as thrown
by a spherical body. Then Medicine tells us that an abundance
of spiders prognosticates a summer of pestilence, and so does
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>a crow’s-foot on the fig leaves in spring. Who is going to allow
this, unless he grants that small things may be indications of
great ones? Who will endure that the magnitude of the sun
should be measured by “half-gallon or half-pint”, or that
the acute angle made on the sundial here by the gnomon
with the surface should be a measure of the elevation of the <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
visible poles above the horizon? Such, at any rate, were the
accounts to be heard from the prophets down there, so that
we must have some other answer to give if we wish to keep for
the sun his constitutional order without deviation.’</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. ‘Not for the sun only,’ cried Ammonius the philosopher,
who was present, ‘but for the whole heavens! For his passage
from solstice to solstice must of necessity be curtailed and not <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>411<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
cover so large a portion of the firmament as mathematicians
say, its southern parts constantly shrinking towards the more
northerly. Our summer, too, must become shorter, and its
temperature colder, as his course curves inwards, and he covers
wider parallels among the tropical constellations. Again, the
gnomons at Syene must cease to throw no shadow at the
summer solstice; many fixed stars would be found to have closed
in, some of them touching others and being mingled with them
as the interval disappeared. If, on the other hand, they shall <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
assert that the other bodies remain as they are, the sun alone
being irregular in his movements, they will be unable to state
the cause which accelerates him alone out of so many bodies,
and will throw most of the phenomena into confusion, those
of the moon entirely, so that there will be no need of measures
of oil to prove the difference; eclipses will prove it, when the sun
comes into contact with the moon more frequently, and the moon
with the earth’s shadow. The rest is clear, and there is no need
to unravel any further the imposture of the theory.’ ‘For all
that,’ said Cleombrotus, ‘I saw the measures with my own
eyes, for they showed me several; that of the current year
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> fell considerably short of the oldest.’ Ammonius rejoined:
‘Then it has escaped all the others who keep up unextinguished
fires, and preserve them for a number of years which we may
call infinite. Assume, however, that what is said is true; is it
not better to take the cause to be atmospheric chills or moisture,
which might probably weaken the fire so that it would
not consume or need so much fuel; on the other hand, times
of dryness or heat? Before now I have heard it said of fire
that it burns better and with more strength in winter, being
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> contracted and condensed by the cold, whereas in hot times
it loses power, and becomes attenuated and feeble; again, that
in sunlight it is less efficient, attacking the fuel sluggishly and
consuming it more slowly. Most likely of all, the true cause may
be in the oil. There is no improbability in thinking that it
was in old days unsubstantial and watery, being produced from a
young plant, but afterwards, when well matured and condensed,
it had more force and better nutritive power in an equal quantity.
I am supposing that we are bound to save this hypothesis
for the servants of Ammon, absurd and unnatural as it is.’</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> V. When Ammonius had done, ‘Rather’, said I, ‘tell us
all about the oracle, Cleombrotus; for the old reputation
of the divine power there was great, nowadays it seems to be
somewhat dwindling.’ As Cleombrotus was silent, and cast
his eyes downwards, Demetrius said: ‘There is no need to
raise questions about what is happening there, when we see
the growing enfeeblement of the oracles nearer home, I might
rather say the cessation of all save one or two; the question
is from what cause has their power thus passed away? Why
mention others, when Boeotia, in old times full of voices with
her oracles, has now been quite deserted, as though by sources of
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> water, and a great drought of prophecy has possessed the land?
Nowhere, except round Lebadeia, has Boeotia anything to
give to those who wish to draw water from prophetic art;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>for the rest, silence or utter desertion is the order. Yet in the
times of the Persian wars it was in no less repute than that of <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>412<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Amphiaraus, and Mys, as it would seem, tried both.<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c006'><sup>[132]</sup></a> So the
prophet of the Ptoan Oracle, in former times accustomed to
use Aeolian, uttered a response in the tongue of the Barbarians,
which none of the local persons present understood, but Mys
alone; however, the Barbarian caught the inspiration, and the
injunction did not need to be translated into Greek. As to
the slave sent to the shrine of Amphiaraus, he seemed to see
in his sleep a minister of the God, who first spoke to turn
him out telling him that the God was not present, then
used his hands to push him, and, when he persisted, took
a great stone and smote him on the head. This was all a <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
prediction in act of what was to come about; for Mardonius
was defeated by the Greeks under no king but a
regent and a lieutenant of a king, and he fell struck by a stone,<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c006'><sup>[133]</sup></a>
just as the Lydian appeared in his sleep to be struck. At that
time the oracle at Tegyrae was flourishing; there they say
that the God was born, and of the streams which flow past
it one, as some tell, is called the “Palm”, the other the “Olive”
to this day. Again, in the Persian wars, when Echecrates
was prophet, the God promised victory and might in war to <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the Greeks. Then in the Peloponnesian war, when the Delians
had been turned out of their island, it is said that an oracle was
brought from Delphi, ordering them to discover the place
where Apollo was born, and to perform certain sacrifices there.
When they were in wonder and perplexity at the idea that the
God had not been born among them but elsewhere, the Pythia
added that a crow should reveal to them the spot. They went
away and reached Chaeroneia, where they heard the landlord
of the inn conversing with certain strangers on their way to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Tegyrae about the oracle. These strangers, on leaving, addressed
the woman in saying farewell as Corone (Crow). Then they
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> understood the oracle, and having sacrificed at Tegyrae, managed
shortly to effect their return. There have been more recent
manifestations at these prophetic shrines, but now they have
failed; so that it may well be worth while here, in the home
of the Pythian, to discuss the cause of the change.’</p>

<p class='c005'>VI. By this time we were away from the temple, and
had reached the doors of the Hall of the Cnidians. Passing
inside, we saw the friends for whom we were making, seated
and waiting for us. There was a general stillness because of
the hour; people were anointing themselves or watching the
athletes. Then Demetrius, with a quiet smile, said: ‘Shall
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> I tell a story, or shall I speak the truth? My belief is that
you have no problem in hand worth a thought; I see you
seated much at your ease, with relaxation on your faces.‘ ‘Oh
yes;’ broke in the Megarian Heracleon, ‘we are not inquiring
whether the verb “to throw” loses a lambda in the future,
nor as to the positive forms of “worse”, “better”, “worst”,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “best”. Those are the questions, those and others like them,
which bring frowns and wrinkles! All others we may examine
like philosophers, with brows steady, and quietly, not looking
death and daggers at the company.’ ‘Then take us as we
are,’ said Demetrius, ‘and with us the subject upon which we
have actually fallen, one which is proper to the place, and concerns
us all for the God’s sake. And mind! no wrinkled
eyebrows when you attack it!’</p>

<p class='c005'>VII. We mingled our companies and sate down in and out
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>413<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> of each other, and Demetrius had propounded the subject,
when up sprang the Cynic Didymus, by nickname Planetiades,
struck the ground two or three times and shouted out: ‘Oho!
Oho! a mighty difficult subject, which needs much inquiry,
you have brought us! A wonder indeed that, with so much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>wickedness poured over the earth, not only “Modesty and
Sense of Justice”, to quote Hesiod,<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c006'><sup>[134]</sup></a> have deserted human
life, but Divine Providence, too, has packed up its oracles and
is gone from everywhere. I throw out the opposite problem
for you to discuss. Why have they not ceased long ago? Why
has not Hercules or some other God withdrawn the tripod, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
filled every day with foul ungodly questions, propounded to
the God by some as if he were a sophist whom they were to
catch out, by others to ask about treasures or inheritances or
marriages which law forbids. The result is that Pythagoras
is proved mighty wrong when he said that men are always at
their best when they approach the Gods.<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c006'><sup>[135]</sup></a> Accordingly, things
which it were decent to cloak and deny in the presence of an
older man, diseases and affections of the soul, these they lay
bare and open before the God!’ He wanted to go on, but
Heracleon plucked at his cloak, and I, almost his greatest <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
intimate present, said: ‘Dear Planetiades, leave off provoking
the God. He is easy to be entreated and gentle:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Mildest to mortal men pronounced to be</i>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>as Pindar<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c006'><sup>[136]</sup></a> says. And whether he be sun, or lord and father
of the sun, lord and father beyond all that is visible, it is not
likely that he should deem us modern men unworthy of
a voice from himself, being to them the cause of birth and
nurture and being and thinking. It is not seemly, either, that
Providence, our thoughtful kindly mother, who produces and
maintains all things for us, should remember our misdeeds in
one matter only—prophecy, and should take away what she <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
originally gave. As if in those old days there were not more
bad men because men were more, when oracles were set up
in so many parts of the inhabited world! Come here, and sit
down again! Swear a Pythian truce with wickedness, whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>you are chastising in word every day; join us in seeking some
other cause for the alleged failure of the oracles.’ My words had
some effect; Planetiades went away by the doors and in silence.</p>

<p class='c005'>VIII. There was a short interval of quiet, then Ammonius
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> addressed me. ‘Lamprias,’ he said, ‘take care what we are
doing, and give your mind to the discussion, lest we find ourselves
making out that the God is no true cause. He who thinks
that the cessation of the oracles is due to something other than
the will of a God, suggests the thought that they come into
being and exist, not because of the God, but in some other
way. For if prophecy be the work of a God, there is no greater
or stronger power to remove and abolish it. Now the argument
of Planetiades displeased me in many points, especially as to
the inconsistency which he makes out in the God, at one time
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> turning away from vice and disowning it, at another admitting
it; as though a king or tyrant were to shut out bad men at
one door, and admit them to interviews by another. Start
with the operation most proper to the Gods, which is great, yet
never excessive, always sufficient in itself; and tell me that
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>414<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Hellas has had the largest share in the general depopulation
caused by former revolutions and wars over the whole perhaps
of the inhabited globe, and could now scarcely provide all
round three thousand hoplites, the number which the single
state of Megara sent out to Plataea.<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c006'><sup>[137]</sup></a> Why, for the God to
have left many places of his oracle would be merely to expose
the desolation of Greece. Then I will put myself in your
hands for ingenuity. For who would get the good if there
were an oracle at Tegyrae as there formerly was, or near
Ptoum, where it is a day’s work to meet one man minding his
flocks. This very spot, most venerable of all and most renowned
“for time and fame”, was for a long time made desert and
unapproachable by a savage beast, a female dragon as the story
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>goes; but this is to invert the facts of its lying idle; the <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
wilderness invited the beast, the beast did not make the wilderness.
But when, in the good pleasure of the God, Hellas revived
in her cities, and the place had men in plenty, two prophetesses
were employed, who were lowered in turn, and a third was
appointed to relieve. Now there is only one, and we do not
complain, for she is enough for those who need her. So we
have no cause to blame the God; the prophetic establishment
now subsisting suffices for all, and sends away all with what
they want. Agamemnon used to employ seven heralds, yet <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
scarcely could control the numerous assembly, whereas in
a few days you will see in the theatre here that a single voice
reaches all present, and even so it is with prophecy; then it
used more voices to reach more persons, now we should fairly
wonder at the God if he allowed his prophecy to flow to waste
like water, or like the rocks to find an echo for the voices of
shepherds and their flocks.’</p>

<p class='c005'>IX. When Ammonius had said this, and I remained silent,
Cleombrotus addressed me: ‘Have you now granted’, he said, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘that the God makes and also destroys the oracles?’ ‘By no
means’, I said. ‘I maintain that no prophetic shrine or oracle is
destroyed by the God’s agency. It is as with many other things
which he makes or provides; Nature brings in destruction
and negation; or rather Matter, which is negation, unweaves
and breaks up that which is brought into being by the more
powerful cause. Even so I think there are times of obscuration
and withdrawal of prophetic forces. The God gives many fair
things to men, but gives nothing immortal, so that, in the words
of Sophocles:<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c006'><sup>[138]</sup></a></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>The works of Gods may die, but not the Gods.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>I say that their essence and their power must be sought in <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Nature and in Matter, the origin being rightly reserved to the
God. It would be simple and childish to suppose that the
God himself creeps into the bodies of the prophets and speaks
from there, using as instruments their mouths and voices, like
those ventriloquists once called “Eurycleis”, now “Pythones”.
He who mixes up the God with mortal needs does not spare
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> his majesty nor preserve the dignity and the greatness of his
excellence.’</p>

<p class='c005'>X. Then Cleombrotus: ‘You are right. Yet it is hard to
grasp and to define how, and up to what point, we may make
use of Providence; and therefore those who make the God
the cause of nothing at all, and also those who make him the
common cause of all, go wide of moderation and decency.
It is well said, on the one hand, that Plato, in discovering
the element which underlies created qualities, now called
“Matter” or “Nature”, relieved philosophers from perplexities
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>415<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> many and great. It seems to me, on the other, that those
who have inserted the class of daemons between Gods and men,
to draw and knit together the fellowship of the two orders
after a fashion, have cleared away more perplexities and greater;
whether the view belongs to Zoroaster and the Magi, or comes
from Thrace and Orpheus, or from Egypt, or from Phrygia,
as we conjecture from seeing in both those countries many
elements of death and mourning in the rites celebrated there,
mingled with those of initiation. Among the Greeks, Homer
appears still to use both names indifferently, and sometimes
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> to call the Gods daemons. Hesiod first clearly and distinctly laid
down four classes of reasonable beings, Gods, then daemons,
then heroes, last of all men; and here he appears to admit
transition, the golden race of men passing into daemons many
and great, the demigods at last into heroes.<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c006'><sup>[139]</sup></a> Others make out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>a change for bodies and souls alike. As water is seen to be
produced out of earth, air from water, and fire from air, and
the substance is borne upwards, even so the better souls receive
their change from men into heroes, from heroes into daemons.
From the daemons again, a few in a long course of time, upborne <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
through virtue, become full partakers of divine nature.
To some it happens not to have control of themselves; so they
subside and again enter mortal bodies, and endure a life as
dim and unillumined as an exhalation.</p>

<p class='c005'>XI. ‘Hesiod thinks that in certain periods of time the
daemons die. Speaking in the person of the Naïd he darkly
indicates the time:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Full ages nine of men that live their prime</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Lives the hoarse crow, four crows the stag outlives,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Three stags the ancient raven, ravens nine</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>The phoenix, but the phoenix, ten times told,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>We fair-haired nymphs, daughters of Zeus most dread.</i><a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c006'><sup>[140]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Those who take the word “age” wrong bring this to a very
large total; it means a year, so that the sum comes out nine
thousand seven hundred and twenty for the years of life of the
daemons. Most mathematicians think it to be less; not even
Pindar<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c006'><sup>[141]</sup></a> has called it greater, when he tells us that the nymphs
live</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Their term appointed even as the trees</i>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>and therefore names them Hamadryads.’ He was still <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
speaking when Demetrius broke in: ‘What was that,
Cleombrotus? The year called an “age of man”? Human
life, whether “at its prime” or, as some<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c006'><sup>[142]</sup></a> read “in its old
age” is not of that length. Those who read “at its prime”,
follow Heraclitus<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c006'><sup>[143]</sup></a> in taking “an age” to be thirty years, the
time in which the parent sees his offspring a parent. Those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>who read “in its old age” instead of “at its prime” give a
hundred and eight years to the “age”, taking the middle term
of human life to be fifty-four, the number made up of unity,
the two first surfaces, the two first squares and the two
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> first cubes,<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c006'><sup>[144]</sup></a> the number taken by Plato<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c006'><sup>[145]</sup></a> in his “Generation
of the Soul”. Hesiod’s whole story seems to have been framed
with a veiled reference to the “Conflagration”, when all things
moist will probably disappear and with them the Nymphs,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Who in fair glades their habitation have</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>By river sources and in grassy meads.</i>‘<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c006'><sup>[146]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>XII. Then Cleombrotus: ‘I hear of this from many, and
now I see the Stoic “Conflagration”, which already spreads over
the verses of Heraclitus and Orpheus, catching those of Hesiod
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>416<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> too! I have no patience with this “World-Conflagration”,
and then the impossibility of the thing! When one can
remember the periods, as it is easiest to do with the crow and
the hind, one sees how exaggeration passes in. The year has
within itself the beginning and the end</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Of all things which the circling seasons bear,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>And parent earth</i>,<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c006'><sup>[147]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>so there is nothing against usage in calling it an “age of man”.
You allow yourselves, I believe, that Hesiod means human
life by “the age”. Is it not so?’ Demetrius agreed. ‘Well,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> but this is also clear,’ said Cleombrotus, ‘that the same words
are often used for the measure and the things measured, as
pint, quart, gallon, bushel. As then we call unity a number,
being the smallest measure of number and its origin, so he has
called our first measure of human life by the same word as the
thing measured—“an age”. The numbers which the others
invent have none of the clarity or distinctness usual in numbers.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>As to the nine thousand seven hundred and twenty, it has come
about by taking the sum of the first four numbers, starting with <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
unity, and multiplying it by four, or four by ten.<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c006'><sup>[148]</sup></a> Thus we get
forty in either way, which, when five times multiplied [triangle-wise]<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c006'><sup>[149]</sup></a>
by three, gave the number proposed. But about these
matters there need be no difference between us and Demetrius.
Whether the time be longer or shorter, determinate or not,
in which the soul of a daemon shifts and the life of a demigod,
the point will have been proved, before any judge he chooses,
on the evidence of wise and ancient witnesses, that there are
certain natures on the borderland between Gods and men,
subject to mortal affections and enforced changes, who may
rightly receive our worship according to the custom of our
fathers, and be thought of as daemons and called so.</p>

<p class='c005'>XIII. ‘Xenocrates, the companion of Plato, used triangles <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
in illustration of the doctrine; he compared the equilateral
to a divine nature, the scalene to a mortal, and the isosceles
to a daemonic; the first equal in all relations, the second unequal
in all, the third equal in some, unequal in others, like the
daemonic nature with its mortal passions and divine power.
Nature has put forward images, which our sense can perceive,
visible likenesses; the sun and the stars standing for Gods,
flashes and comets and meteors for mortal men, an image
which Euripides<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c006'><sup>[150]</sup></a> drew in the lines: <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>In all his bloom, like to a falling star</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>His light was quenched, his spirit passed, to air.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>But there is a being which is mixed, and really an imitation
of the daemons, the moon. Men, seeing her circumference so
much in accord with that order of beings, the manifest wanings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>and waxings and phases which she undergoes, have called her,
some an earthlike star, others an Olympian earth, others “the
portion of Hecate”, who belongs at once to heaven and earth.
As, then, if one were to remove the lower air, withdrawing all
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> between earth and moon, an empty unconnected space would
be left, and the unity and continuity of the whole dissolved,
even so those who refuse to leave us the daemons break off
all intercourse and mutual dealing between Gods and men,
by removing that order in Nature which could “interpret”,
in Plato’s<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c006'><sup>[151]</sup></a> words, and “minister”, or else they compel us to
mingle all things into one mass, forcing the God into human
passions and business, and drawing him down to our needs,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>417<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> as Thessalian witches are said to draw the moon. Only their
imposture found credit with women, when Aglaonice the
daughter of Hegetor, who knew her astronomy, chose an
eclipse of the moon, and then pretended to do magic and
draw her down. But as for us, let us never listen when we
are told that there are prophecies with no divine agency, or
rites and orgiastic services which the Gods do not heed; nor
on the other hand suppose that the God is in and out and present
there, taking part in the business. Let us leave all this to those
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> rightful ministers of the Gods, their ushers or clerks. Let us
hold that there are daemons who watch the performance
of rites, and inspire the mysteries, while others go about to
avenge crimes of insolence and pride, and to others Hesiod<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c006'><sup>[152]</sup></a>
has given a venerable name,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in30'><i>of wealth</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>The saintly givers; such their kingly trust</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Observe that to do so is kingly. For there are, as among men,
so among daemons, degrees of excellence, and in some subsists
still some slight, faint, almost excremental remnant of passion
and absence of reason; in others this is strong and hard to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>do away, its traces and symbols being in many places preserved
and sporadically found in sacrifices and rites and tales of wonder. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c005'>XIV. ‘Now as to the mystic rites, in which the most evident
and transparent indication may be had of the truth about
daemons, “peace be upon my lips”, as Herodotus<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c006'><sup>[153]</sup></a> says. Feasts
and sacrifices, days sinister and gloomy, so to call them, when
are meals of raw flesh, and rendings and fastings and beaten
breasts, and in many places unholy spells over the sacrifices:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Whoopings wild, and cries of frenzy, necks together tossed in air</i>,<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c006'><sup>[154]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>all these, I would say, belong to no God, but are modes of
appeasement and soothing to avert bad daemons. The human
sacrifices which used to be performed were neither asked for
nor accepted by Gods, we cannot believe it; yet kings and <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
captains would not have endured to give up their own children
by way of initiating the rites, or to cut their throats, without
a purpose; it was to soothe and satisfy the heavy displeasure
of beings cruel and hard to be moved, or in some cases
their frantic low passions, worthy of tyrants, when bodily
approach was impossible or not desired. As Hercules besieged
the town of Oechalia for the sake of a maiden, so strong and
violent daemons, requiring in vain a human soul still enveloped in
the body, bring pestilences to cities and sterility of land, and
stir up wars and seditions, until they succeed in getting that
on which their affection is set. Some have fared otherwise; <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
thus in a long stay in Crete I came to know of an absurd
festival observed there: the headless form of a man is shown,
and you are told that this was Molus, father of Meriones, who
assaulted a maiden and was found without a head.</p>

<p class='c005'>XV. ‘Now all the crimes of violence, all the wanderings
of Gods, all tales of hiding, banishment, servitude, which are <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
said or sung in myth or hymn, are adventures which happened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>not to Gods but to daemons, and are recorded to show their
excellence or power; Aeschylus<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c006'><sup>[155]</sup></a> was wrong when he wrote</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Apollo pure, the God exil’d from heav’n</i>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>and so was the Admetus in Sophocles<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c006'><sup>[156]</sup></a> wrong:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Mine was the cock who called him to the mill.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Widest of the truth of all are the theologians of Delphi, who,
thinking that a battle once took place here between the God
and a serpent for the possession of the oracle, allow poets and
speech-writers contending in the theatres to tell these stories,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>418<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> expressly belying their own most sacred rites.’ Philippus,
the historian, who chanced to be present, here expressed
surprise, and asked: ‘What rites such competitors belied?’
‘Those relating to the oracle,’ was the reply, ‘whereby the
city, admitting to initiation those from here to Tempe has
now banished all Greeks dwelling beyond Thermopylae.<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c006'><sup>[157]</sup></a> For
the booth set up afresh every nine years near the court of the
temple is not like any den or serpent’s haunt, but is an imitation
of the dwelling of a tyrant or king. And the assault made
upon it in silence through what they call “Dolon’s Way”, by
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> which the Aeolidae bring the boy, both of whose parents are
living, with lighted torches, put fire to the booth, overturn the
table, and then flee through the gates of the temple without
turning back; and lastly the wanderings of the boy and his
servile offices, and the purification rites at Tempe, all convey
a suspicion of some great crime of shocking audacity. For it is
quite absurd, my friend, that Apollo, after killing a beast, should
flee to the extremities of Greece in quest of purification, and
then should pour libations there and do all which men do to
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> appease and soften the wrath of daemons (fiends and avengers
as they are called, because they pursue the memories of old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>unforgotten stains). The story which I once heard about that
flight and removal is strangely absurd and surprising; but if
there be any truth in it, let us never believe that what passed
about the oracle in these old times was any trifling or ordinary
matter. However, fearing to seem to do what Empedocles
describes:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Stringing sundry myths, nor ever keeping to a single path</i>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>I will ask you to allow me to affix the proper conclusion to my
first tale, for we have just reached it. Many have said it before <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
us; let us dare to say it now. When the daemons who have
to do with oracles and prophecies fail, all such things fail too,
and lose their force if the daemons flee or shift their place;
then, if they return after an interval, the things speak aloud, like
instruments of music when those who can play them are present
to play.’</p>

<p class='c005'>XVI. When Cleombrotus had finished, Heracleon spoke:
‘There is no profane or uninitiated person present, no one who
holds views about the Gods discordant with our own; but
let us keep jealous watch on ourselves, Philippus, lest without
our own knowledge we assume strange and even monstrous <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
hypotheses.’ ‘Well said,’ answered Philippus, ‘but what
shocks you specially in what Cleombrotus is advancing?’
‘That the oracles should be administered,’ said Heracleon,
‘not by Gods, who may well be quit of earthly concerns, but
by daemons, assistants of the God, seems to me a not unfair
assumption; but then to pluck, I had almost said by the handful,
out of the verses of Empedocles, sins, infatuations, and God-inflicted
wanderings, and to fasten them upon these daemons,
and to suppose that in the end they die like men, this I do
think a somewhat bold and barbarian view.’ Here Cleombrotus <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
asked Philippus who and whence the young man was, and, after
learning his name and city, said: ‘No, Heracleon, it is by no
means “without our own knowledge” that we have reached
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>strange propositions; but in discussing great matters it is not
possible to attain what is probable in opinion without starting
from great premisses. But you, though you do not know it yourself,
are taking back what you grant. You allow that there are
daemons; but when you require that they should not be faulty
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>419<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> nor yet mortal, it is no longer daemons that you retain. For
in what do they differ from Gods if as to their being they are
immortal, and as to virtue are passionless and impeccable?’</p>

<p class='c005'>XVII. As Heracleon remained silent and in deep thought,
he went on: ‘Faulty daemons come to us not from Empedocles
only, but from Plato and Xenocrates and Chrysippus; yes, and
Democritus,<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c006'><sup>[158]</sup></a> when he prays to meet “fair-falling phantoms”,
shows that he knew of others which were disagreeable, with
definitely vicious intentions and impulses. As to death in such
beings, I have heard a story from a man who was no fool or
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> romancer. Some of you have heard Aemilianus the orator;
Epitherses was his father, my fellow-townsman and teacher in
grammar. He said that he was once on a voyage to Italy, and
embarked on board a ship carrying cargo and many passengers.
It was already evening when the breeze died down off the
Echinades Islands; and the ship drifted till it was near Paxi.
Most on board were awake, and many still drinking after supper.
Suddenly a voice was heard from the island of Paxi; some one
was calling Thamus in a loud voice, so that they all wondered.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Thamus was an Egyptian pilot, not even known by name to
many of the passengers. Twice he was called, and remained
silent; the third time he paid attention to the caller, who raised
his voice and said: “When you reach the Palodes, tell them
that Great Pan is dead.” Hearing this, Epitherses said, all were
in consternation, and began discussing with one another whether
“it were better to do as was ordered, or to refuse to meddle
and to let it be. They decided in the end that, if there were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>a breeze, Thamus should sail past quietly, but if there should
be calm about the place, he should hail, and report. When
he was off the Palodes, as there was neither wind nor wave, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Thamus at the helm looked to land and repeated the words he
had heard: “Great Pan is dead.” He had no sooner done
this than a great groaning was heard, proceeding not from one
but from many, mingled with cries of wonder. As there were
many present, the story was soon spread in Rome, and Thamus
was sent for by Tiberius Caesar, who so entirely credited
the story, that he caused inquiry to be made about Pan. The
scholars, of whom there were many round him, conjectured
that he was the son born of Hermes and Penelope.’<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c006'><sup>[159]</sup></a> (Philippus <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
was able to produce several witnesses from the company who
had heard the old Aemilianus.)</p>

<p class='c005'>XVIII. Demetrius told us that, among the islands near
Britain, many were deserted and lay scattered (Sporades),
some of them bearing the names of daemons and demigods.
He himself, by the Emperor’s command, made a voyage of
inquiry and observation to the nearest of the deserted islands,
which had a few inhabitants, all sacred persons and never
molested by the Britons. Just after his arrival, there was
a great confusion in the atmosphere, many portents from
the sky with gusts of wind and fiery blasts. When these calmed <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
down, the islanders said that ‘one of the mightier ones has
ceased to be.’ For as a lamp when lighted, so they explained,
has no unpleasant effect, but when extinguished is disagreeable
to many people, so it is with great souls: their kindling into life is
easy and free from pain; their extinction and death often breed
winds and tempests, ‘such as you see now’, and infect the air
with pestilence and sickness. They added that there is one
island in particular where Cronus is a prisoner, being guarded
in his sleep by Briareus; for sleep has been devised to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>a chain to bind him, and there are many daemons about him
as satellites and attendants.<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c006'><sup>[160]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>XIX. Cleombrotus spoke next: ‘I have stories of the same
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>420<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> kind which I might tell; but it is enough for our hypothesis
that there is nothing which actually contradicts it or makes
such things impossible. Yet we know’, he continued, ‘that
the Stoics not only hold the view which I am advancing with
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> reference to daemons, but also recognize one out of the great
multitude of Gods who is eternal and immortal; the others,
they think, have come into being, and will perish. From the
flouts and laughter of the Epicureans, which they venture
to employ against Providence also, calling it a mere myth, we
have nothing to fear. We maintain that their “Infinity”
is a myth; so many worlds, not one of which is governed by
divine reason, all produced spontaneously, and so subsisting.
If it be permissible to laugh in speaking of Philosophy, we may
laugh at the dumb, blind, soulless images which they shepherd
during countless cycles of years, to reappear and anon return
in all directions, some issuing from bodies still living, some
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> from those long ago burned or rotted. Thus they drag into
physiology cyphers and shadows; yet if one asserts that
daemons exist not in physical nature only, but as matter of
theory, able to remain in being for long periods of time, they
show irritation.’</p>

<p class='c005'>XX. When these views had been stated, Ammonius spoke:
‘I think’, he said, ‘the dictum of Theophrastus was right.
For what prevents our accepting a view which is dignified
and highly philosophical? To disallow it is to reject many
things possible but incapable of positive proof; to allow it
is not<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c006'><sup>[161]</sup></a> necessarily to import many which are impossible and
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> baseless. However, the only argument which I have heard the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>Epicureans employ against the daemons as introduced by
Empedocles, that, if they are faulty and liable to sins, they
cannot be blessed beings and long-lived, because vice implies
much blindness and a liability to destructive accidents, is
a foolish one. For, on this showing, Epicurus will be a worse
man than Gorgias the sophist, and Metrodorus than Alexis
the writer of comedies. For Alexis lived twice as long as
Metrodorus, and Gorgias more than a third as long again
as Epicurus. It is in another sense that we call virtue strong and <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
vice weak, not with regard to the duration or dissolution of
body. Look at the lower animals: many which are sluggish in
limb and dull in spirit, loose or disorderly in habits, live longer
terms than the sensible and ingenious. Hence the Epicureans
do wrong in ascribing the immortality of God to the caution
and resistance which he opposes to destructive forces. No,
the immunity from suffering and death should be laid in the
nature of the blessed being, and should imply no trouble on
his part. Perhaps, however, it is inconsiderate to argue against
persons not present. It is now for Cleombrotus to resume his <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
argument lately interrupted, about the migration and exile of
the daemons.’</p>

<p class='c005'>XXI. Then Cleombrotus: ‘Very well; I shall be surprised,
however, if it does not appear to you much stranger than what
we have already said. Yet its basis lies in Nature, and Plato
struck the note, not stating his view in plain terms, but as an
obscure theory, cautiously throwing out a hint in enigmatical
form; for all which even he has been met with a great outcry <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>421<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
from the other philosophers. Now since we are here with a bowl
in our midst of mingled myths and theories—and where should
a man meet with kinder listeners before whom to try theories
as foreign coins are tried?—I do not hesitate to give you the
benefit of the story of a certain outlandish man. It was after
many wanderings and after paying heavy search fees, that
I found him at last with difficulty, and enjoyed his conversation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>and kindly welcome. It was near the Red Sea, where once
every year he associated with men, spending the rest of his
time, as he used to say, with nomad nymphs and deities. He
was the handsomest man I ever saw, and kept free from sickness
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> of any sort, treating himself once a month with the medicinal
and bitter fruit of a grass. He was practised in the use of many
tongues; to me he would mostly use a Doric, which was very
nearly a song. While he was speaking, there was a fragrance
in all the place from the sweet breath passing out of his mouth.
His general learning and information were with him all the
time; but one day in every year he was inspired with prophecy,
and would then go down to the sea and foretell the future;
potentates and secretaries of kings would come to visit him
and then go away. He used to refer prophecy to daemons;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> he paid the greatest attention to Delphi, and there were none
of the stories told of Dionysus, or of the rites performed here,
of which he had not heard. But he would say that all those
stories belonged to mighty sufferings of daemons, and among
them this of the Python; only that his slayer was not exiled
for nine years nor to Tempe, but was turned out into another
universe, returning thence after nine revolutions of the Great
Year, purified and “Phoebus” indeed, to resume possession
of the oracle, which had been guarded in the meanwhile by
Themis. That the stories of the Typhons and Titans were
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> similar; there had been battles of daemons against daemons,
followed by banishment of the defeated or expiation of offenders
by a God, for instance, Typhon is said to have sinned against
Osiris, and Cronus against Uranus; deities whose honours
have become dim or been altogether forgotten since they
were removed to another universe. Thus I hear that the
Solymi, who dwell near the Lycians, hold Cronus in special
honour; but when he had slain their princes, Arsalus, Dryus,
and Trosobius, he was banished and removed (whither they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>cannot say). So he passed out of account, but Arsalus and his
fellows are called “stern Gods”, and the Lycians publicly <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and in private make execrations in their names. Many stories
like these may be had out of theological collections.’ ‘But if
we call certain daemons by the recognized names of Gods,’
the stranger said, ‘it should be no wonder, for to whatever
God each has been assigned, to share his power and honour,
after him he likes to be called; even as among ourselves one
is “of Zeus”, one “of Athena”, one “of Apollo,” one “of
Dionysus”, one “of Hermes”; only some have by accident
been rightly called, most have received names quite inappropriate, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
misapplied names of Gods.’</p>

<p class='c005'>XXII. Here Cleombrotus paused. All present found his
story a marvellous one, but Heracleon asked how it bore upon
Plato, and in what sense he had given the note. ‘You perfectly
remember’, said Cleombrotus, ‘that he rejected, on
the face of it, an infinity of worlds, but felt a difficulty as to <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>422<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
a limited number, and was ready to go up to five,<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c006'><sup>[162]</sup></a> thus conceding
probability to those who assume one world for each
element, but himself keeping to one. This appears to be
peculiar to Plato, the other philosophers<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c006'><sup>[163]</sup></a> regarding with
horror any plurality, because, if you do not limit matter to
one world, when you pass outside unity you arrive at once at
an unlimited and perplexing infinity.’ ‘But did your stranger’,
I asked, ‘limit the number of worlds as Plato does, or did you
neglect to find this out when you were with him?’ ‘Was it <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
likely,’ said Cleombrotus, ‘when he graciously put himself at
my disposal? On these points, if on nothing else, I was, of
course, an attentive and eager listener. What he said was that
there is not an infinite number of worlds, nor yet one, nor yet
five, but one hundred and eighty-three, arranged in a triangle
with sixty worlds in each side. Of the three left over, each is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>placed at one angle. Each world keeps a light touch on its
neighbours while they revolve as in a dance. The area inside
the triangle is the common hearth of all, and is called the “Plain
of Truth”, and within it the formulae, and ideas, and patterns,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> of things which have been and things which are, lie undisturbed.
Eternity is around them, and from it, like a stream drawn off
from it, Time passes to the worlds. Once in ten thousand
years human souls, if they have lived good lives, are allowed
to see and inspect this sight; and the best of the initiations
performed here are a dream of that review and that initiation.
In our philosophical discourses we are working on the memory
of the fair things which are seen there, or else our discourse is
vain. This’, he said, ‘is the tale I heard from him; he spoke as
a man does in the mystery of an initiation, and offered no
demonstration or evidence.’</p>

<p class='c005'>XXIII. I turned to Demetrius: ‘How’, I said, ‘do the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> lines about the Suitors run, where they wondered to see Ulysses
handling the bow?’ When he had remembered them, ‘Just’,
I said, ‘what it comes into my head to say about your stranger:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Surely the rogue some pilfering expert is</i><a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c006'><sup>[164]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>in doctrines and theories from everywhere. He had travelled
widely in letters, and he was no Barbarian, but a Greek steeped
deeply in Greek learning. The number of his worlds proves
it against him, for it is not Egyptian nor yet Indian, but Dorian
of Sicily, and comes from a man of Himera named Petron.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> His own pamphlet I never read and I do not know whether
it is extant; but Hippys of Rhegium, mentioned by Phanias
of Eresus, records it as his view or theory that there are
one hundred and eighty-three worlds all in touch with one
another “by elements”, whatever that may mean; he gives
no further explanation or proof of any sort.’ ‘What proof
could there be’, broke in Demetrius, ‘in matters of that sort,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>where Plato, without a word to make it reasonable or likely,
simply laid down his theory?’ ‘And yet’, said Heracleon, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘we hear you grammarians referring the view to Homer,<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c006'><sup>[165]</sup></a> on
the ground that he distributes the whole into five worlds,
Heaven, Water, Air, Earth, Olympus. Two of these he leaves
“common”, namely, Earth with all the lower portion of the
whole, Olympus with all the upper. The three in the middle
have been allotted to the three Gods. So also Plato,<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c006'><sup>[166]</sup></a> apparently
assigning to the different aspects of the whole the bodily forms <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>423<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and figures which are the most beautiful and the first, spoke of
five worlds, one each for earth, water, air, fire, but kept for last
that which includes the others, the world of the Dodecahedron,
an expansible and versatile body, and assigned to it the figure
which suits the psychical periods and movements.’ Demetrius
said: ‘Why not let sleeping Homers lie for the present?
We have had enough of myths. But as to Plato, he is very far
from calling the five different aspects of the world five worlds;
and, where he is combating those who assume an infinite number,
states his own opinion that this is the only one, and is the sole
creation of God and beloved by him, brought into being <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
out of the corporeal whole, entire, complete, and self-sufficing.
Hence it may appear strange that he should himself state the
truth, yet supply to others the fundamental principle of
a view which is improbable and irrational. To give up the
defence of a single world was in a sort to grant the assumption
of the infinity of the whole. To make the definite number of
worlds five, neither more nor less, was quite against reason and
removed from all probability. Unless’, he added, turning to
me, ‘you have anything to say?’ ‘It seems to me’, I said, ‘to
come to this, that you have now dropped our discussion about
oracles, as concluded, and are taking up a fresh one of equal <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
importance.’ ‘We have not dropped the old one,’ said Demetrius,
‘only we do not decline the new when it fastens on us. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>we do not mean to linger upon it, only to touch on it sufficiently
to ask how far it is probable; then we will return to the original
subject.’</p>

<p class='c005'>XXIV. ‘In the first place then,’ I said, ‘the reasons
which prevent the making of an infinite number of worlds do
not prevent the making of more worlds than one. It is possible
that both prophecy and a Providence may find place in several
worlds, and that the intrusion of Chance may be very small,
while most things, and those the greatest, observe order in
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> their origin and their transition, none of which suppositions
is consistent with Infinity. In the next place, it is most
consonant with reason that God should not have made the
world a sole creation and left it to itself. For, being perfectly
good, he is lacking in no virtue, least of all in the virtues of
Justice and Friendliness, for these are most beautiful and becoming
Gods. Now it is the nature of God to have nothing which
is idle or without use. Therefore there are other Gods and
worlds outside, towards which he exercises the social virtues;
for Justice, or Gratitude, or Benevolence, cannot be exercised
towards himself or any part of himself, it must be towards
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> others. So it is not likely that this world should toss about
in the infinite void without friends, without neighbours, without
communication; since we see Nature herself wrapping up
individuals in classes and species, as though in jars or seed-vessels.
There is nothing in the whole list of things which has not
some common formula, nor can anything be called by a distinctive
name which does not possess, generically or individually,
certain qualities.<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c006'><sup>[167]</sup></a> But the world is not spoken of as possessing
generic qualities; it has qualities then as an individual, which
distinguish it from others akin to and resembling itself. For
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> if there is not in the world such a thing as one man, one horse,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>one star, one God, one daemon, what is to prevent there being
in Nature not one world, but several? If any one says that
Nature has one earth and one sea, he fails to see the obvious
fact of similar parts. For we divide earth into parts, all with
one common name, and sea likewise. But a part of the world is
no longer a world; it is composed of parts naturally different.</p>

<p class='c005'>XXV. ‘Again, the chief fear which has led some to use <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>424<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
up the whole of matter on our world, that nothing may be
left outside to disturb its coherence by resistance or thrusts, is
a needless one. For suppose several worlds, to each of which
is apportioned its own being, and matter definitely measured
and limited, then nothing will be left outside without place
or formation, like an extruded remnant, to put pressure from
without. For the law which has control of the matter allotted
to each world will not allow anything to be thrust out and
wander to strike upon another world, or anything from another
to strike its own, because Nature admits neither quantity
without limit, nor movement without law and arrangement. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Or, even if any stream be drawn off and pass from worlds to
other worlds, it must needs be homogeneous and kindly,
mingling itself mildly with all, as the stars when they blend
their rays. And the worlds themselves must have delight,
as they gaze on one another in friendliness, and must also
provide for the Gods in each, who are many and good, times
of intercourse and common cheerfulness. There is nothing
impossible in all this, no fairy tale and no paradox; unless,
mark me, the views of Aristotle<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c006'><sup>[168]</sup></a> are to bring it into suspicion
on physical grounds. For if each body has its own place, as
he says it has, earth must necessarily move towards the centre <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
from every side, and the water rest upon it, underlying the
lighter elements because of its weight. If, then, there are many
worlds, the result will be that earth is in many places above
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>fire and air, and in many below them; and the same with air
and water too, which will be here in natural places, there in
unnatural. Which being impossible, as he thinks, there must
neither be two worlds nor more than two, but this one only,
composed of all matter, and established according to Nature
and to the several qualities of matter.</p>

<p class='c005'>XXVI. ‘However, all this is more plausible than true.
Look at it in this way,’ I went on, ‘dear Demetrius: when
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> he says that some bodies move downward towards the middle,
others upwards from the middle, others around the middle,
with reference to what does he take the middle? Not to the
void surely, for on his view there is none. But in the view of
those who allow a void, it has no middle, just as it has no
first or last, for these are limits, but the infinite has no limits.
Or if a man were to force himself, by sheer thinking, to conceive
any middle point in an infinite void, what is the resulting
difference in the movements of the different bodies towards
it? Bodies have no force in the void, nor yet have bodies any
choice or impulse to make them aim at the middle and tend
towards it from all sides. Besides, where there are bodies with
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> no soul, and a place which is incorporeal and without difference
of parts, it is as impossible to conceive of any movement
towards it arising out of themselves, as of any attraction upon
them arising out of it. It remains that the middle is spoken
of not in a local sense but in a corporeal. For granted that
this world has unity of structure with many dissimilar elements,
the different parts have necessarily different movements
towards different objects. This is clear from the consideration
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> that different elements, where their substance is transferred,
change their places at the same time; rarefaction distributes
in a circular movement the matter raised upwards from the
middle; consolidation and condensation press matter downward
towards the middle and force it together.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>XXVII. ‘On this subject more words are needless here.
Whatever you assume to be the effective cause of these vicissitudes
and changes, it will hold each world together within
itself. Each world has earth and sea, each has a middle point <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>425<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of its own, its own vicissitudes and changes of the bodies upon
it, and a nature and a force which preserve everything and keep
it in its place. As for what is outside, whether it be nothing
or an infinite void, it presents no middle point, as we have
said; while, if there be many worlds, each has a middle point
of its own, and therefore a special movement of bodies to or
from or about that middle (to follow the distinction made by
these thinkers). To insist that, where there are many middle
points, weights press from all sides to one, is as though we should
insist that, whereas there are many men, the blood from all
should flow together into a single vein, and the brains of all
be enveloped in a single pia mater; and to make it a grievance <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
that all hard bodies in nature should not be together in one
place, and all rarefied bodies in another. That would be preposterous,
and equally so to complain that wholes should have
their parts disposed in their natural order within each of them.
It might be absurd to call that a world which has a moon
low down<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c006'><sup>[169]</sup></a> within it, like a man with his brain lodged in his
ankles or his heart in his temples. But to make several independent
worlds, and then to differentiate the parts in sets to
follow their wholes, and so divide them, is not absurd. Earth, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
sea, and heaven will be in their natural and proper arrangement
within each. Above, below, around, middle have no relation
to another world or to the outside, each world has them all in
and for itself.</p>

<p class='c005'>XXVIII. ‘As to the “stone” which some assume to be outside
the world, it is not easy to form a conception of it, either
as at rest or in motion. For how is it either to remain at rest,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>being weighty, or to move towards the world, like other heavy
bodies, being no part of it nor reckoned in with its substance?
Earth embraced in another world, and attached to it, need cause
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> no difficulty, when it does not part from the whole because
of its weight, and shift hitherwards, since we see the natural
strain by which each of the parts is held in its place. For if we
look, not to the world but outside it, to get our conception
of “below” and “above”, we shall find ourselves in the same
difficulties as Epicurus, who made all his atoms move to places
under our feet, as though either the void had feet, or infinite
space permitted us to conceive of “above” or “below”
within itself! Hence, again, we must feel surprise at Chrysippus,
or indeed be quite at a loss as to what possessed him to say that
the world has been settled “in the middle”, and that its
substance, having occupied this middle place from all eternity,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> works therewith for permanence and in fact for indestructibility.
These are his words in the Fourth Book of his work on “<i>Things
Possible</i>”, where he falsely dreams of a middle of the infinite,
and assigns, still more preposterously, to that non-existent middle
the cause of the stability of the world; and yet he had often said
in other works, that substance is controlled and maintained by
the movements towards and away from its own middle point.</p>

<p class='c005'>XXIX. ‘Then as to the other arguments of the Stoics,
who can find them alarming? They ask how we are to keep
one Destiny and one Providence if there are many worlds, and
whether we shall not have many “Diès” and many “Zenès”.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In the first place, if it is absurd that we should have Zeus in
the plural number, surely their scheme will be far more absurd;
for they make, in the revolutions of infinite worlds, sun, moon,
Apollo, Artemis, Poseidon, all multiplied to infinity. Then,
what makes it necessary that there should be many “Diès”,
if there are more worlds than one, rather than one principal
God the emperor of the whole, possessing intelligence and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>reason, sovereign in each world, such a one as he who is called
with us lord and father of all? Or what is to prevent all worlds <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>426<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
from being subject to the Destiny and Providence of Zeus, and
that he should overlook and control each in turn, supplying
to each the principles, the seeds, the formulae of all which is
brought about? It cannot be that here we often have a single
body composed of diverse bodies, as an assembly, an army,
a choir, each of whose component bodies has life, thought,
apprehension (and this is the view of Chrysippus), and yet
that it should be impossible that in the Whole there should be
ten worlds or fifty, or a hundred, all based on a common <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
formula, and ranged under a single principle. Nay, such a disposition
is altogether worthy of Gods. We have not to make
them sovereigns of a hive out of which they never pass; to
guard, nor to enclose or imprison them in matter, which is
what the Stoics do when they make the Gods atmospheric
phases, or powers of the waters or the fire, infused therein,
brought into being with their world and again burnt up with
it, not leaving them unattached or free, as charioteers or steersmen
might be; but rather, as statues are nailed or soldered
to their bases, shut into the corporeal and clamped thereto, to
share with it till there come destruction and general dissolution
and change.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> For the Zeus of Homer<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c006'><sup>[170]</sup></a> had not very far to carry his eye from
Troy to the parts of Thrace, and the wandering tribes about
the Ister; but the real Zeus has beautiful passages and becoming
to himself among worlds more than one, not looking out upon
an infinite void, nor having his mind intent upon himself and
nothing else (as was the view of some), but surveying many
works of Gods and men, and movements and periodic orbits
of stars. The divine nature is no foe to changes, but takes
much delight in them, if we may judge from the bodies which
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> appear in the heavens, their changes and periods. Now Infinity
is altogether without feeling or reason; it has no room to admit
a God, all goes by chance and spontaneously. But the Providence
which cares for worlds defined and limited in number
appears to me to involve nothing less dignified or more
laborious than that which has entered a single body, and
attached itself thereto, to refashion or shape it anew in
infinite particulars.’</p>

<p class='c005'>XXXI. Having said so much, I paused. Philippus, after
a short interval, went on: ‘Whether the truth about these
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> things be so, or not, I could not, for my own part, assert with
confidence. But if we are to force the God outside one world,
why make him the artificer of five worlds and no more; and
what is the bearing of that number on the plurality of worlds?
I would rather be informed on this point than as to the inner
meaning of the consecration of the letter “E” in this place.
That letter is neither triangle, nor square, nor “perfect”,
nor cubic, nor has it any other apparent elegance for those
who love and admire such things. The process out of the elements,
at which the Master obscurely hinted, is hard to grasp
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>427<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> in every respect, and shows none of that probability which must
have drawn him on to say that it is likely that out of five solid
bodies having equal angles and equal faces and enclosed by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>figures of equal area, when set into matter, the same number
of perfect worlds was at once produced.’</p>

<p class='c005'>XXXII. ‘Yes,’ said I, ‘yet Theodorus of Soli seems to
treat the argument very fairly, in expounding the Mathematics
of Plato. This is his method: the Pyramid, the Octahedron,
the Eicosahedron and the Dodecahedron, the solid figures
which Plato ranks first, are all beautiful because of the symmetry
and equality of their formulae; nothing better than
these or equal to them has been left over for Nature to compose <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
or to frame. They have not, however, all been constructed
on a single plan, nor have all a similar origin. The Pyramid
is the finest and smallest, the largest and the one of most parts
is the Dodecahedron; of the remaining two the Eicosahedron is
more than double the Octahedron in number of triangles.<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c006'><sup>[171]</sup></a> It
follows that it is impossible for all to take their origin at once
from one and the same matter. For those which are fine and
small, and more simple in their structures, must be the first to
obey him who stirs and fashions the mass; they must sooner
cohere and be completed than those whose parts are abundant,
and the figures complex, and their construction more laborious, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
as the Dodecahedron. It follows that the Pyramid is the only
primal body, and that none of the others is so; they are left
behind by Nature in the becoming. For this strange result
there is, however, a remedy, the division and distribution of
matter into five worlds. Here the Pyramid (for it first formed substance),
there the Octahedron, in a third world the Eicosahedron.
But from the figure which first took substance in each the rest
will take their origin, all change arising by concretion or dissolution
of parts, as Plato himself shows.<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c006'><sup>[172]</sup></a> He goes thoroughly
into nearly all the cases, but for us a brief survey will suffice.
Since air is formed when fire is extinguished, and when rarefied <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
again yields fire out of itself, we must observe what happens to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>the seeds of either element, and the changes. The seeds of
fire<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c006'><sup>[173]</sup></a> are the Pyramid with its twenty-four primary triangles;
the seeds of air are the Octahedron with its forty-eight. Therefore
one element of air is formed by the commixture and coherence
of two of fire; and one of air is exchanged into two of
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> fire, or by close pressure into itself passes away into the form
of water. Thus, universally, that which is first formed readily
allows the others to come into being by transmutation. It
is not the case that one is first; different elements in different
structures give the initial and prerogative movement into
being, yet the common name is kept throughout.’</p>

<p class='c005'>XXXIII. ‘Bravo, Theodorus!’ said Ammonius; ‘he has
worked out his task with spirit. Yet I shall be surprised if he
is not found to be using assumptions which are mutually
destructive. He wants to have it that all five solids do
not attain their structure together, the finest and easiest of
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> composition always breaking first into being. Then, as though
following upon this, and not conflicting with it, he lays it
down that it is not all matter which admits the finest and simplest
element first, but that sometimes the heavy and complex objects
are the first to emerge out of matter. But to pass over this,
whereas it is assumed that there are five primal bodies, and
therefore an equal number of worlds, he makes out probability
for four only; he has discarded the Cube as if playing at
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>428<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> counters, since Nature does not adapt it to pass into the others
or them into itself, because the triangles are not of the same
kind. In the other cases the basis of formation is the semi-(equilateral)
triangle; to the Cube the right-angled isosceles
is peculiar, which is incapable of converging towards the others
or joining with them to form one solid angle. If then, there
are five bodies and five worlds, and in each the primary belongs
to some one, then where the Cube has been the first to come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>into being, the rest will be nowhere, for it is unable to change
into any of them. I pass by the fact that they make the element
of the Dodecahedron also a different thing from that scalene <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
out of which Plato constructs the Pyramid, the Octahedron,
and the Eicosahedron. And so’, added Ammonius, with a laugh,
‘you must either resolve these difficulties, or give us something
of your own about the common problem.’</p>

<p class='c005'>XXXIV. ‘I have nothing more probable to offer, at least
at the moment;’ I said, ‘yet perhaps it is better to show
cause for one’s own view than for that of others. I say then,
going back to the beginning, that if we assume two natures,
one sensible, liable to changes of becoming and perishing,
and to various movements at different times, the other essential,
intellectual, always behaving alike under the same conditions, it is
strange, friend, that the intellectual should admit of distinction
and division within itself, while with regard to that which is
bodily, and subject to affections, there should be trouble and <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
dissatisfaction if we refuse to leave it one, self-coherent and
self-convergent, but separate and part it. Surely it is rather the
permanent and divine which should hold together and shrink,
as far as may be, from all dissection and analysis. Yet the force
of “the Other” has gripped them, and has worked greater
divergences than those of place in things intellectual, I mean
those made by Reason and Idea. Hence Plato,<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c006'><sup>[174]</sup></a> opposing those
who make out the Whole to be one, tells us of Being, and the <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Same, and the Different, and, besides all these, of Movement
and Rest. Given then these five, it would not be wonderful
if these five corporeal elements have been made by Nature
copies and images of them severally, none free from admixture
or transparent, but each element so far as it could best participate
in each principle. Thus the Cube is clearly a body congenial
to Rest, because of the stability and firmness of its surfaces.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>No one can fail to detect the fire-like, active character of the
Pyramid in the fineness of its sides and the sharpness of its
angles. The nature of the Dodecahedron, which embraces
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> the other figures, might well be taken for an image of Being
in relation to all that is corporeal. Of the remaining two, the
Eicosahedron is found most to partake of the idea of the Different,
the Octahedron of that of the Same. Therefore the latter
represented air, which holds all being in one constant form,
the former water, which when mixed assumes new qualities the
most numerous. If then Nature requires throughout equality
before the law, it is probable that worlds have been created
neither more nor less in number than the patterns, in order that
each pattern in each world may hold that primacy and power
which it has had in the composition of the elementary bodies.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> XXXV. ‘So much for that! May it reassure any one who
is surprised at our dividing the natural processes of becoming
and mutation into so many classes! Now comes another point,
which I will ask you all to consider with me. Of the ultimate
first principles, by which I mean unity and the undelimited
two, the latter, as the element of all shapelessness and disorder,
has been called Infinity; but unity by its nature limits and
arrests what is void and irrational and undetermined in
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>429<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Infinity, and imparts shape, and fits it to receive and endure
that definition of things apprehended by the senses which is
implied in counting. These principles appear first in connexion
with number; but I would rather say, universally, that plurality
is not number until unity supervenes, as form upon matter,
and cuts off from undetermined Infinity, more on this side, less
on that. For plurality in each case only becomes number when
it is determined by unity. Again, if unity be struck off, the
undetermined two throws all into a confusion without balance
or limit or measure. Now since form is not a withdrawal
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> of underlying matter but is shape and order thereof, both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>principles must necessarily be found in number, and hence
arises the first and greatest difference or dissimilarity. The
undetermined principle is the constructive cause of the even,
the better one of the odd. Two is the first of the even numbers,
three of the odd; out of them comes five, in its composition
common to both lists, in its effect, odd. For when the sensible
and corporeal was to be divided into several parts, in virtue
of the inherent cogency of the Other, their number must
not be the first even nor yet the first odd, but the third, that
formed out of these, so that it may take its origin from both <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
principles, that which constructs the even and that which
constructs the odd; for neither could possibly be separated
from the other; each possesses the nature and power of
a principle. Both principles then being paired, the better one
checked the indeterminate when it was dividing up the corporeal;
and prevailed; when matter was being distributed between
the two it set unity in the middle, and did not allow an equal
division of the whole. So a plurality of worlds has been brought
into being by the “Other” quality in the undetermined, and
by difference; but that plurality is odd, made so by the
operation of “the Same” and “the Determinate”, and odd
in such a sense that Nature was not allowed to advance beyond
what was best. For if the unity had been without admixture <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and pure, matter would have been exempt from any breaking
up whatever; but as it has been mingled with the discriminative
power of the two, separation and division were so far accepted;
but there it stopped, the even overcome by the odd.</p>

<p class='c005'>XXXVI. ‘Hence again the ancients were accustomed to
use the words “to take fives” for to count. I think, too,
that the word for “all” (<i>panta</i>) has been logically formed
as though from “five” (<i>pente</i>) because the number five is
composed of the first numbers. For the others when multiplied
by other numbers come out to a product different from themselves;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>but five if taken an even number of times gives a perfect
ten, if an odd, it reproduces itself. I pass over the facts
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> that five is composed of the first two squares, one and four,
and that its own square is equal to the sum of the two before
it, forming with them the most beautiful of right-angled
triangles, and that it is the first number to give sesquiplicate
ratio. For perhaps they are not germane to the subject before
us. This, however, is more germane, that the number five has
a divisory virtue, and Nature divides most things by five. In
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> ourselves are five senses, and there are five parts of the soul,
those of growth, sense, appetite, passion, reason. We have
five fingers on each hand; seed is most fertile when it parts
into five (no instance has been recorded of a woman bearing
more than five at a birth); Rhea is said in Egyptian mythology
to have given birth to five Gods,<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c006'><sup>[175]</sup></a> a veiled reference to the
production of the five worlds out of one matter. Turning to
the universe, the surface of earth is divided into five zones,
and the Heavens are divided by five circles, two Arctic, two
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>430<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Tropic, one in the middle, the Equinoctial. Five are the
orbits of the planets, if we take those of the sun and Venus and
Mercury as one. Lastly, the universe has been composed in
the Enharmonic Scale, just as our melody is made up of the
arrangement of five Tetrachords, lowest, middle, conjunct,
disjunct, highest. And the intervals are five: diesis, semitone,
tone, tone and a half, double tone. Thus it seems that Nature
loves to make all things on the principle of five, rather than,
as Aristotle<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c006'><sup>[176]</sup></a> used to say, of the Sphere.</p>

<p class='c005'>XXXVII. ‘What is the real reason, some one will ask, why
Plato<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c006'><sup>[177]</sup></a> referred the number of five for his worlds to the five
solid figures, saying that “God used the fifth formation on the
universe to mark it out”? In the sequel, when he raises the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> problem of plurality of worlds, whether we should properly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>speak of one or of five as naturally existing, he shows clearly
that the suggestion came from the solids. If, then, we are to
adjust what is actually probable to his conception, let us consider
that difference in movement must in each case follow difference
in the solids and their shapes, as Plato<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c006'><sup>[178]</sup></a> himself teaches, when he <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
shows that what is rarefied or condensed suffers a change of
place simultaneously with alteration of substance. If from air
fire be formed, the Octahedron being resolved and broken up
into Pyramids, or again if air from fire, when compressed and
thrust into an Octahedron, it is impossible that either should
remain where it was before; they fly off rapidly to another
place, forcing a way out and battling with whatever resists and
presses upon them. The result is shown still more clearly by
an illustration from grain “tossed and winnowed by the fans
and implements used for cleaning corn”; Plato<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c006'><sup>[179]</sup></a> says that <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
in like manner the elements toss matter about and are tossed
by it; like approaches like, different objects take different
places, before the whole comes out finally marshalled. Thus
then, matter being what any universe must be from which God
is absent, the first five properties, each with its own tendency,
at once began to move apart, not being entirely or purely
separated, because, when all things were mixed up together,
the vanquished particles always followed their conquerors,
in despite of Nature. Hence they produced in the kinds of
bodies, as they were borne in different directions, parts and
divisions as many as themselves: one not of pure fire but <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
resembling fire, one not of unmixed air but resembling air,
one not of earth simple and absolute but resembling earth.
Most general was the association of air with water, because
they passed out saturated with the many other classes. For
God did not separate nor disperse being; but taking it up dispersed
by its own operation and borne about in so many streams
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>of disorder, he ordered and disposed it in symmetry and proportion.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Then he set reason in each to be a governor and
guardian, and created as many worlds as there were kinds of
primal bodies. Let so much then be inscribed to Plato for
Ammonius’ sake. For myself, I could never speak with confidence
as to the number of worlds and affirm that there are so
many: but I think the view that there are more than one,
yet not an indefinite but a limited number, as reasonable as
either of the other views, when I see how scattered and divided
matter naturally is, that it does not abide in one place, nor yet
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>431<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> is suffered by reason to pass into Infinity. Here, if anywhere,
let us remember the Academy rule, and clear ourselves of
excessive credulity, and treading on this slippery ground when
reasoning about Infinity, only make sure that we keep our
footing.’</p>

<p class='c005'>XXXVIII. When I had finished, ‘Lamprias gives us
sound advice’, said Demetrius. ‘The Gods by many forms—not
“of sophistries”, as it is in Euripides,<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c006'><sup>[180]</sup></a> but of things—deceive
us, when we dare to pronounce opinions about these
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> great matters as if we knew. But “we must cry back”, to
quote the same authority,<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c006'><sup>[181]</sup></a> to the assumption from which our
argument started. The statement that the oracles, when the
daemons move off and desert them, lie idle and speechless,
like musical instruments with none to play on them, raises
another and a greater question as to the cause and power
whereby they make the prophets and prophetesses subject to
fits of inspiration and fancy. For it is impossible to allege the
desertion as a cause of the silence unless we are first satisfied
in what sense they preside and by their presence make the
oracle active and vocal.’ ‘What?’ rejoined Ammonius, ‘do
you suppose that the daemons are anything but souls which
move around, as Hesiod<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c006'><sup>[182]</sup></a> says “garmented in mist”? In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>my view, as man differs from man when he plays tragedy or <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
plays comedy, so soul differs from soul after it has fashioned for
itself a body convenient to its present life. It is not then
irrational or even wonderful that souls meeting souls should
create within them fancies of that which is to be, just as we
convey to one another, not only through voice, but often
by written signs, by a touch, a glance, many intimations of
things past, and forewarnings of things future. Or perhaps
you have something different to tell us, Lamprias? For a
rumour reached us lately that you had held a long discussion
on these subjects with strangers at Lebadeia; but our informant <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
did not clearly remember any of it.’ ‘Do not be surprised
at that,’ I said, ‘for there were many interruptions and much
was going on, because it was a day of consultation and sacrifice,
which made our conversation fragmentary and intermittent.’
‘But now’, said Ammonius, ‘you have listeners with full
leisure, and eager to inquire and to be told. There is no
question of rivalry or faction, and you see what a frank full
hearing has been accorded to every view.’</p>

<p class='c005'>XXXIX. The others joined in encouraging me, and after
a few minutes of silence I went on: ‘I must begin by saying <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
that it so happens that you, Ammonius, have given me a sort of
opening for bringing forward now what I then said. For if
the souls which have been separated from the body or have
never had commerce with one at all, are daemons as you say,
and God-like Hesiod<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c006'><sup>[183]</sup></a> also:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Holy visitants of Earth and guardians sure of mortal men</i>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>on what principle do we deprive souls while in their bodies
of that faculty whereby the daemons know and declare beforehand
things to be? It is not likely that any power or new part
accrues to souls when they leave the body, which they did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>possess before. Rather, they always have it, but in a weak
degree while they are intermingled with the body; it is sometimes
quite invisible and veiled, sometimes weak and dim, and,
as with those who see through a mist or who try to move in
a marshy place, inoperative and dull, demanding much attention
to the virtue that is in them, and much pains to raise and remove
and purify the obstructing veil. The sun when he chases the
clouds away does not then become bright; he is bright always,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>432<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> but to us through the mist his light appears dim and struggling.
Even so the soul does not assume the prophetic power when
it passes out of the body as out of a cloud; it has it even now,
but is blinded by its close admixture with the mortal state.
We should not be surprised or incredulous, if only because we
see the great energy which Memory, as we call the faculty in
the soul which answers to prophecy, exhibits, in preserving
and protecting things that are past, or rather things that now
are,<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c006'><sup>[184]</sup></a> since of things past none is or has substance; all things
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> come into being and at the same time perish, all actions, words,
and feelings, as time like a river bears each along. But this
faculty of the soul, I know not how, gets a grasp of them, and invests
with appearance and being that which is not present. The
oracle given to the Thessalians about Arne<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c006'><sup>[185]</sup></a> bade them attend to</p>

<p class='c011'>But Memory is the hearing of things to which the ear is deaf,
the seeing of things to which the eye is blind. Wherefore, as
I said, it is no marvel that, as it grasps things which no longer
are, so it should anticipate things which have not yet come
into being. For these touch it more nearly, and with these it
has sympathy; it confronts the future and attaches itself
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> thereto, whereas it is quit of things past and finished, saving only
to remember them.</p>

hardly appearing, souls nevertheless break out and are uplifted,
in dreams some of them or when nearing initiation, as the body
becomes pure, and takes on a temperature, so to speak, which
is suitable, or whether it be that the rational and intellectual
part is relaxed and discharged from the present things, and so
with the irrational and imaginative they reach towards futurity.
That line of Euripides<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c006'><sup>[186]</sup></a> is not true:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>

      <div class='line'><i>The best of prophets he who guesses well.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>No, the prophet is the sensible man, he who follows the rational
part of his soul in the road where it leads him with probability.
Divination, like a scroll with no writing or method, in itself <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
indeterminate, but capable of receiving fancies and presentiments
by the feelings, gets touch with the future, yet not by
inference, when it passes most completely outside the present.
It passes out through such a temperament and disposition
of the body as produce a change called by us inspiration. Often
the body attains this disposition of itself; but the earth sends
up many streams of many potencies, some which bring trances,
diseases, or death, others beneficial, mild, and serviceable, as
is proved on those who chance upon them. Of all the currents
the stream, or breath, of prophecy is most divine and holy, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
whether it be drawn from the air direct, or come mingled with
the moisture of a spring; for when absorbed into the body it
produces in souls a temperament unfamiliar and strange, the
special quality of which it is hard to state in clear words, though
reason suggests many conjectures. Probably, by heat and dispersion,
it opens certain passages to admit imaginings of the future,
just as the fumes of wine bring many other stirrings, and unveil
words and thoughts which were stored away and unheeded, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>says Euripides;<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c006'><sup>[187]</sup></a> when the soul, warmed and set on fire,
rejects the caution which human prudence brings, to avert
inspiration, as it so often does, and to quench it.</p>

<p class='c005'>XLI. ‘After all, it might be not unreasonably asserted
that a dryness introduced with the heat subtilizes the current
and makes it ethereal and pure. “Best a dry soul”, says Heraclitus;<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c006'><sup>[188]</sup></a>
moisture not only dulls sight and hearing, but if it

and lustre. As the opposite to this, it is not impossible that,
by a sort of chilling and condensation of the breath of air, the
organ of prognostication is made tense and keen, like steel
out of the bath. Or again, as tin when melted in with copper,
itself rarefied and full of apertures, welds it together and condenses
it, and yet in the result makes it brighter to the eye
and purer, so there is nothing to prevent the prophetic exhalation,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> wherein is something congenial and akin to souls, from filling
up their rarefied places, and inserting itself, and pressing all
together. For certain things are congenial and proper to certain
other things; thus an infusion of the bean into the dyer’s
bath seems to assist its efficacy for purple, of nitre for saffron.</p>

<p class='c011'>says Empedocles. But about Cydnus, and the sacred sword
of Apollo at Tarsus, we used to hear the story from you, dear
Demetrius, how Cydnus cleans that steel best, and no other
water suits the sword. And again, at Olympia, water from
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Alpheus is poured on the ashes to make them adhere to the
altar in a mass, and the water of no other river which has
been found has the power of cementing the ash.</p>

<p class='c005'>XLII. ‘It is not to be wondered at, then, that of the many
streams which the earth sends up, these alone affect souls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>with inspiration and give them imagination of the future.
Certainly legend agrees with reason as to this. In this very
place it is related that the prophetic virtue was first made
manifest by the accidental falling into it of a shepherd, who
thereupon uttered sounds as of one inspired. These passed
at first unheeded by those present; but afterwards, when the
things which the man foretold had happened, there was astonishment.
The most learned of the Delphians even mention <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the man’s name, which was Coretas. I am, however, myself
strongly of opinion that a soul acquires a temperature congruous
with the prophetic current, such as the eye has with light
sympathetic to it. Though the eye possesses the power of seeing,
this cannot act without light; and the prophetic organ
of the soul needs, as the eye does, a congenial medium to help
in kindling its flame, or whetting its edge. Hence most of the
older generations used to think that Apollo and the sun were
one and the same God, while those who knew and honoured
that beautiful and wise proportion, “as body to soul, so sight <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
to intellect, so light to truth”, would add the conjecture “so the
power of the sun to the nature of Apollo”, declaring the sun to
be his offspring and scion, the ever becoming of the ever subsisting.
For the sun kindles and enhances and helps to excite the visual
power of the sense, as the God that of prophecy in the soul.</p>

<p class='c005'>XLIII. ‘It was natural, however, that those who take the
view that they are one and the same God should have dedicated
this oracle to Apollo and Earth in common, thinking that the
sun produces in the earth the disposition and temperament
from which come the prophetic exhalations out of her. We <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
then, like Hesiod,<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c006'><sup>[190]</sup></a> who understood the matter better than some
philosophers, when he called her</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Unshaken base of all</i>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>consider her to be eternal and imperishable. But of the powers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>which are about her it is to be expected that some should fail
here, and others come into being there, and that there should
be shiftings from place to place, and cross-currents, and that
such cycles should often revolve within her if we take time as
a whole; and the phenomena point to such an inference. For in
the case of lakes and rivers, and still more frequently in that of
hot springs, there have been failure and entire disappearance in
some places, in others a retreat so to call it, and an absorption;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>434<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> then they reappear at intervals of time in the same places, or bubble
up in their neighbourhood. Again, we hear of mines where the
ore has been exhausted and then renewed, as in the silver mines of
Attica, and the copper lodes of Euboea, out of which the chilled
sword-blades used to be manufactured, as Aeschylus<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c006'><sup>[191]</sup></a> has said</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Th’ Euboean blade, self-tempered, in his hand.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Then there is the rock at Carystus where it is only lately
that the yield of delicate thread-like filaments of mineral
has ceased. I think some of you will remember having seen
towels, and nets, and caps made of these, which were non-inflammable.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Any which were soiled by use were placed in
a flame out of which they came bright and clear. Now there
has been an entire disappearance of these, and scarcely a few
fibres or thin filaments run in streaks about the mines.</p>

<p class='c005'>XLIV. ‘Yet Aristotle<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c006'><sup>[192]</sup></a> holds that exhalation is the operative
cause within the earth of all these things, that is, of the
natural effects which necessarily fail, shift place, and break out
concomitantly. The same view must be taken of prophetic
currents; the power which they have is not perennial nor
ageless, it is liable to changes. Probably they are extinguished
by excessive storms of rain, and dispersed by thunderbolts
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> falling upon them; above all, when the earth is shaken, and
subsidence or conglomeration takes place in her depths, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>exhalations are shifted or wholly lost to view; thus the effects
of the great earthquake which actually overturned the town
are said to be permanent here. In Orchomenus they say that
there was a pestilence in which many men perished, and that
the oracle of Teiresias then wholly failed, and remains to this
day idle and voiceless. If the like happened also to those in
Cilicia, as we hear it did, there is no one, Demetrius, who
could tell us about it more clearly than you.’</p>

<p class='c005'>XLV. Demetrius said: ‘I cannot say how things are
now, for it is a long time since I left home, as you know; the <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
oracle of Mopsus was in full force when I was there, and also
that of Amphilochus. I can tell you of a very remarkable
thing which happened to that of Mopsus, in my presence.
The propraetor of Cilicia was himself still of two minds about
religious questions; from the weakness of his scepticism,
I imagine, for his general character was violent and bad; but
he had about him certain Epicureans, professed mockers at all
such things on the strength of their fine physiology. He sent
in a freedman, equipping him like a spy going into an enemy’s
land, with sealed tablets inside which was written the question,
but no one knew what it was. The man spent a night in the <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
sanctuary, as the custom was, and went to sleep. The following
day he reported a dream, which was this. He thought that
a handsome man stood over him, and said the one word “Black”,
nothing more, and went straight away. This appeared to us
strange, and caused much perplexity. However, that propraetor
was struck with consternation, and worshipped; then
he opened the tablets and showed us this question written inside:
“Shall I sacrifice a white bull or a black?” Even the Epicureans <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
were confounded at this, and he himself completed his sacrifice,
and ever afterwards held Mopsus in reverence.’</p>

<p class='c005'>XLVI. After saying this, Demetrius was silent. As I wished
to bring the discussion to a head, I glanced again at Philippus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>and Ammonius, who were sitting together. They appeared
to me to wish to exchange some remarks, and again paused.
Then Ammonius spoke: ‘Philippus has also something to say
on our past discussion; his own view, as that of most people,
is that Apollo is not a different God from the sun, but the same.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>435<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> My own difficulty is a greater one, and turns on greater matters.
Just now we managed to let the argument take its own way
with due solemnity, to transfer prophetic art simply from Gods
to daemons. But now it seems to me that we are thrusting the
latter out in their turn, chasing them hence from oracle and
tripod, and resolving the origin—I would rather say the existence
and power—of prophecy into winds, and vapours, and
exhalations. What we have heard about temperatures, and
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> heatings and sharpenings, withdraws no doubt the credit from
the Gods, but thereby suggests the inference as to cause which
the Cyclops in Euripides<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c006'><sup>[193]</sup></a> draws:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>The earth by force, whether it will or no,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Bringing forth grass, fattens my flocks and hinds.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Only he says that he does not sacrifice to Gods,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in30'><i>but to myself,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>And this great belly first of deities</i>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>whereas we sacrifice and pray to get our oracles; and why do
we do it, if souls carry within themselves a power of prophecy,
which power is stirred up by temperature of some sort in air
or breeze? And then the condition of the priestesses, what does
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> that mean, and the refusal to respond unless the whole victim
from the hoof-joint up be set quivering when it is sprinkled?
For it is not enough, as in other sacrifices, for it to shake the head,
the shivering must be in all the parts, and with a tremulous
sound; otherwise they tell you that the oracle is not giving
responses, and do not bring in the Pythia. Now, if they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>ascribe the cause mainly to a God or daemon, it is reasonable
to do and think thus, but on your view it is not reasonable.
For the exhalation, if it be there, will produce the transport
whether the sacrifice quiver or not, and will affect the soul, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
not only of the Pythia, but equally of any chance comer who
has physical contact with it. Thus it is mere folly to employ
one woman only for the oracles, and to take trouble to keep her
chaste and holy all her life. For that Coretas who fell in, as
the Delphians tell you, and was the first to make evident the
virtue of the place, was in no respect different, as I think, from
the other goatherds and shepherds, always supposing that this
is not a story and an idle fiction, which I think it is. Then,
when I reckon up the great benefits of which this oracle has been
the cause to the Greeks, in wars, in the founding of cities, in <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
times of pestilence and of failure of crops, I think it dreadful to
ascribe its discovery and origin, not to God and Providence, but to
Chance and automatic causes. It is this point’, he added, ‘that I
want Lamprias to argue; will you not wait?’ ‘Indeed I will,’ said
Philippus, ‘and so will the others, the discussion has stirred us all.’</p>

<p class='c005'>XLVII. I turned to him. ‘Stirred us, Philippus? It
has confounded me, to think that before so large and so grave
a company I should seem so to forget my years as with a show
of plausible rhetoric to upset and disturb any view about
religion which is established in truth and holiness. I will <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
defend myself by producing Plato, as witness and advocate in
one. Plato<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c006'><sup>[194]</sup></a> found fault with old Anaxagoras because he
attached himself too much to physical causes, and because, in
his constant pursuit of the working of necessary law in all
which affects bodies, he dismissed the better causes or principles,
the Final and the Efficient. He himself, first of the philosophers
or more than any of them, went into both sets, attributing to
God the origin of all things which are according to reason, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>436<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> refusing to deprive matter of the causes necessary for their production;
he recognized that in some such way the whole
sensible universe is organized, yet is not pure nor free from
admixture, but has its origin in matter involved with reason.
Now look at this first in the case of the artists. Take, for instance,
the famous base or stand, called by Herodotus<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c006'><sup>[195]</sup></a> “cup-stand”,
of the bowl here; it had its physical causes, iron, steel, fire to
soften and water to temper it, without all which the object
could not possibly be produced; but the more potent principle
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> which stirred the others and was working through them, was
furnished to it by Art and Reason. Now the name of the maker
or artificer has been inscribed on these several figures or works
of imitation:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Here Polygnotus, son of Aglaophon,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>The Thasian, painted towering Ilion’s sack.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>You may see it for yourself. But without pigments crushed and
compounded it would be impossible to present such a composition
to the eye. Does then the man who seeks to grasp the
physical principle, investigating and laying down the effects and
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> the changes of a mixture of Sinopic red earth with yellow, or
Melian gray with black, rob the painter of his glory? Or he
who follows out the processes of tempering or softening steel,
how it is weakened by fire and submits itself to be drawn and
hammered, then, plunged into fresh water and compressed and
densified by the cold, because of the softness and rarefication
induced by the fire, acquires temper and consistence—“the
iron’s might” Homer<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c006'><sup>[196]</sup></a> calls it—does he any the less preserve
for the artist his part in the causation? I think not! There
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> are those who criticize the properties of medical appliances;
they do not overthrow the art of Medicine. As, for the matter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>of that, Plato<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c006'><sup>[197]</sup></a> in proving that we see by means of the flash
of our eyes mingling with that of the sun, and hear by the
pulsations of the air, did not rule out the fact that we have
received our sight and our hearing in accordance with Reason
and Providence.</p>

<p class='c005'>XLVIII. ‘The whole matter, as I maintain, stands thus.
All becoming has two causes, of which the most ancient theologians
and poets chose to turn their attention to the stronger
only, pronouncing over all things the universal refrain:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Zeus first, Zeus middle, all things are of Zeus</i>,<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c006'><sup>[198]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>while they never approached the necessary or physical causes.
Their successors, called physicists, did the very reverse; they <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
strayed away from that beautiful and divine principle, and
refer everything to bodies, and pulsations, and changes, and
temperaments. Hence the systems of both are deficient; they
have ignored or neglected, the latter the person through whom
and the agent by whom, the former the things from which
and the means through which. He who first distinctly grasped
both, and attached by necessary law the subject affected to
the rational Maker and Mover, relieves us as well as himself
from any charge of contempt or detraction. We do not make <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
prophecy a godless or irrational thing, when we assign to it
for its matter the soul of man, and for its instrument, or harp-quill,
the inspiring current and the exhalation. For, in the
first place, the earth which breeds the exhalations, and the sun
who gives to earth all power of temperature or of change, are
reckoned Gods in the traditions of our fathers. Further, in
leaving daemons to preside over and guard this temperature,
as though it were a melody, to relax the strings in due course <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>437<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
or to tighten, to clear away that excess of ecstasy and agitation
which it causes in the worshippers, and to leave excitement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>a painless and harmless compound, we shall not be thought
to do what is irrational or impossible.</p>

<p class='c005'>XLIX. ‘Nor can we allow that in offering the previous
sacrifice, or crowning the victim, or pouring on it lustral
draughts, we do anything repugnant to this view. For when
the priests and holy men sacrifice the victim, and sprinkle it,
and watch its movement and its trembling, they do not profess
to get from it an intimation of anything but the one fact that
the God is giving answers. For the thing offered in sacrifice
must be pure both in body and in soul, and free from any
injury or taint. As to body, it is not very difficult to make
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> out visible proof; the test of soul is to offer corn to the bulls,
pease to the he-goats; an animal which refuses is reckoned out
of health. For the she-goat it is cold water; a soul in a normal
state cannot be apathetic and motionless under the sprinkling.
For my own part, even if it be certain that trembling is a sign
that the God is ready to give responses, the contrary that he
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> is not, I see no disastrous consequence. As I said before, every
natural force produces its result better or worse according to
season; if the right season is escaping us, it is to be expected that
the God should signify the fact.</p>

<p class='c005'>L. ‘I think, further, that the exhalation is not always the
same, it has times of relaxation and of intensity. In proof,
I can bring forward witnesses, many of them strangers, and all
the members of the temple staff. For the room in which they
place consultants of the God, is, at intervals, which are not
frequent or fixed, but come as it may happen, filled with
fragrance and a sweet gale, such as the most costly spices might
emit, which are thrown up, as out of a well, from the sanctuary.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> We may suppose that they burst out by the action of heat or
of some other force within. Or, if this does not seem to you
convincing, you will at least grant that the Pythia herself
appears to show at different times different states and moods of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>that part of the soul which is in contact with the current, and
does not present throughout one temperament, like a melody
which never changes. Many conscious troubles and excitements,
more which are unnoticed, seize her body and stream on into
the soul; and when she is charged with these, it is better for
her not to go in, not to present herself to the God when she
is not perfectly pure, like an instrument well strung and tuneful,
but is passionate and disordered. Wine does not always affect <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the hard drinker in the same way, nor the flute one susceptible
to its music; the same men are stirred to tipsy revelling, now
less now more, according to difference of temperament. The
imaginative part of the soul seems, more than any other, to
be controlled by variations in the body, and to change with it.
This is clearly shown by dreams; sometimes we find ourselves
among many visions of every sort in our sleep, at others again
there is a perfect calm and relief from such illusions. We know <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
ourselves Cleon here of Daulia, who says that in the many years
which he has lived he has never once seen a dream-vision. In
an older generation the same is recorded of Thrasymedes of
Heraea. The cause is bodily temperament, just as, on the other
side, there is that of melancholic persons, all dreams and phantoms;
although these are supposed to have the gift of dreaming
right, for their imagination turns them this way or that, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>438<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
just as those who shoot often, often hit.</p>

<p class='c005'>LI. ‘When then the imaginative and prophetic faculty of
the soul is attempered to the current as to a drug, the inspiration
must be brought about in the persons who are to prophesy,
when not, not; otherwise the result will be a distortion by no
means free from trouble and disturbance, as we know was the
case with the Pythia who lately died. A deputation came from
abroad to consult the God; the victim remained motionless
and impassive under the first sprinkling, then the priests in <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
excess of zeal persisted, and at last it did give in when drenched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>with their shower-bath. What happened to the Pythia?
Unwillingly and with no alacrity, they say, she went down
into the vault. In her very first answers she made it clear by
the hoarseness of her voice that she could not bear up; she was
like a ship driven by the wind, filled with a dumb bad spirit.
At last she became all agitation; with a terrible cry she made
towards the door of exit, and dashed against it, so that not
only the members of the deputation fled, but also the prophet
Nicander and the holy persons present. However, after a short
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> time, they went in and recovered her. She was then in her
senses, and lived on for a few days. For these reasons, they keep
the person of the Pythia free from intercourse, and from any
sort of communication or contact with strangers; and they
take the signs before proceeding to the oracle, thinking that
it is quite clear to the God when she has the temperament
and condition which will allow her to undergo the inspiration
with impunity. For the force of the exhaled air does not affect
all persons, nor the same persons always in the same way;
it only provides fuel, a foundation, as has been explained, for
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> those who are fit to be subjected to the change. It is essentially
divine and daemonic, not however exempt from failure, or
destruction, or age, nor is it capable of enduring through that
infinite space of time in which all things between moon and
earth are exhausted, according to our theory. Some go on to
say that the things also which are above the moon do not
endure, but fail in presence of the eternal infinite, and suffer
abrupt changes and new births.</p>

<p class='c005'>LII. ‘These things’, I continued, ‘I commend to your
repeated consideration, and my own, as offering many openings
for objection and many suggestions of an opposite view, which
the present opportunity does not allow us to follow out in their

  <h2 id='chap06' class='c003'>ON THE INSTANCES OF DELAY <br /> IN DIVINE PUNISHMENT</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c009'>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p class='c004'>The Dialogue on <i>Delay in Divine Punishment</i> stands somewhat
apart from the others. It deals gravely with grave matters,
the ways of Providence with man, and the ‘last things’.
The method is ingenious and satisfactory. An Epicurean, after
scoffing at Providence in a manner which deeply offends the
company, leaves them abruptly. We are reminded of the
departure of the Cynic Didymus at Delphi (p. <a href='#Page_124'>124</a>), and of the
immortal episode of Thrasymachus in the First Book of the
<i>Republic</i> of Plato. The small family party which remains,
Plutarch, his brother Timon, his son-in-law Patrocleas, and an
intimate friend Olympicus, take up the points suggested by
the attack, not contentiously, or in the language of the Schools,
but with a view to ascertain whether there is anything in them
which concerns reasonable men. The friends successively raise
these points: the slowness of the Gods in punishing, and their
purposes in the delay; the justice of visiting the sins of parents
upon children, or of a city upon a new generation of citizens;
the persistence of the soul after physical death here. In all cases
it is Plutarch who supplies the answer, whereas, in the other long
Dialogues, there is some distribution of parts and an interplay
of character. In the tone of the dissertations, which is sustained,
and little relieved by humour, the piece most nearly
resembles the essay <i>On Superstition</i>. Plutarch’s argument is
marked by truly academic caution, and an admission of man’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>ignorance and limitations, which might have come from the
pen of Bishop Butler.</p>

<p class='c005'>When Plutarch has sufficiently established ‘to demonstration’
the ‘probability’ of his position, he adds, at the urgent desire
of the company, a myth, which he had already offered to produce.
The ‘myth’ is a device of which Plato has many
examples, intended to give symmetry to the Dialogue, ‘that it
may not go about without a head’. But it is more than
a literary device; it is a satisfaction of the desire for something
poetical and constructive which mere Dialectic can never feed.
The myth about Thespesius here must be compared with that
of Timarchus in the <i>Genius of Socrates</i> and with the traveller’s
tale of the Island of Cronus in the <i>Face in the Moon</i>.<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c006'><sup>[199]</sup></a> Of
Platonic myths, we are first reminded of that of Er, which closes
the <i>Republic</i>, and raises to a higher plane the question whether
the just man or the unjust has the best of it. There are
necessarily strong points of resemblance to the magnificent
judgement myth of the <i>Gorgias</i>, and much of the imagery recalls
the <i>Phaedo</i>. The <i>Timaeus</i> is not perhaps so conspicuously before
Plutarch’s mind here as it is in other works. While there is so
much which can be referred to Plato, there is nothing to suggest
that Plutarch set himself to make a patchwork out of the stores
of his retentive memory, still less that he sought to imitate the
master from whose genius his industrious and curious mind lay
poles apart. His honesty and his common-sense forbade any
such attempt.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is fortunate that we possess a fragment (redeemed for
Plutarch by Wyttenbach) of a Dialogue with the same speakers,
and perhaps intended to follow immediately, in which, as
though in ‘calculated contrast’, writes M. Gréard (p. 292), to
the grim details contained in the Dialogue before us, we have
a delightful picture of what awaits the just beyond the grave, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>truly ‘initiate’. As all the questions discussed in the main
Dialogue are raised in old Greek writers, Homer, Pindar, the
Tragedians, supplemented by the philosophers, and the myth,
in its stern imagery, is on all fours, for instance, with the
<i>Eumenides</i> of Aeschylus, so the comfortable vision of the initiate
in the fragment is anticipated by Greeks who wrote four hundred
or five hundred years before. Thus we have the lines of the
<i>Frogs</i> of Aristophanes (154 foll., tr. G. Murray):</p>

      <div class='line'><i>And clapping of glad hands.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>And the still more famous picture of Pindar (<i>Ol.</i> 2, 68-74,
tr. G. Moberly):</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'><i>But who in Godlike strife</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Have dared to keep their secret souls from sin,</i></div>
      <div class='line in4'><i>Thrice tried in either life,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>E’en to old Saturn’s tower their bright way win.</i></div>
      <div class='line in4'><i>There with melodious din</i></div>

      <div class='line in4'><i>Some from the Island-trees,</i></div>
      <div class='line in4'><i>Some floating on the ambient seas,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>With which their twinèd arms and brows they wreathe.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Perhaps it would hardly be untrue to say that the whole of
Plutarch’s daring speculation owes its origin to the words of
Heraclitus, with which the fragment closes, as to the surprises
which await man after death.</p>

<p class='c005'>There is one distinct note of date, in the Sibylline prophecy
quoted in c. 22, that the emperor of that day should die in his
bed. Vespasian, who was doubtless meant, died in June,
<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 79, and the great eruption of Vesuvius (by which, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>Puteoli does not appear to have suffered specially) took place
in August of the same year. The Dialogue must have been
written later than these events. On the whole, if we may venture
a conjecture where all is uncertain, we may perhaps suppose
it to have followed the <i>Symposiacs</i> at a comparatively short
interval, and to have been an early attempt to apply the method
of dialogue to elaborate discussion of great themes. It has
characteristics of its own which enable us to understand how
Erasmus (<i>Adagia</i>)<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c006'><sup>[200]</sup></a> felt doubts as to its genuineness, though we
have the confident assurance of Wyttenbach that there is
Plutarch’s seal upon it.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>I. Having spoken to this effect, Quintus, before any one <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>548 <span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
replied—we had just reached the far end of the colonnade—Epicurus
took himself off. We stopped our walk for a while, in
silent surprise at the oddness of the man, then glanced at one
another, turned back, and resumed it. Patrocleas was the first
to speak: ‘Which is it to be,’ he said, ‘are you for dropping
the inquiry, or shall we answer the argument as though the
speaker of it were present, though he is not present?’ Timon
interposed: ‘Well, suppose he had thrown a spear and gone
away, it would not do quietly to let it lie. Brasidas,<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c006'><sup>[201]</sup></a> we are <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
given to believe, drew the spear out of his wound, and with it
struck and slew the thrower. Now perhaps it is no business
of ours to punish those who have discharged a monstrous or
a false argument at us; enough if we eject it from ourselves
before it has taken hold.’ ‘Then what is it’, I asked, ‘which
has moved you most, in what he said? for there were a number
of things, a disorderly mass, which the man drew from all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>quarters, to let them off against Divine Providence in his rage
and fury.’</p>

<p class='c005'>II. Then Patrocleas: ‘The slowness and procrastination
of Divine Justice in the punishment of wicked men appears to
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> me especially terrible. At the present moment, after what we
have just heard, I seem to come “all fresh and new” to this
(Epicurean) view; but long ago I used to feel indignant when
I heard Euripides<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c006'><sup>[202]</sup></a> telling how</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>The Gods delay, the Gods are ever slow.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Yet it does not become the God to be slack in anything, least of
all in dealing with wicked men; they are never slack or procrastinating
in evil-doing, but are borne on by the passions at
racing speed into their iniquities. Again, “Vengeance, when
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> it follows most closely upon the wrongs,” to use the words of
Thucydides,<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c006'><sup>[203]</sup></a> at once blocks the road against those who are in the
fullest enjoyment of successful vice. No debt so surely as the
debt of justice, if left unpaid till the morrow, at once depresses
the person wronged by enfeebling his hopes, and enhances the
boldness and self-trust of the miscreant; whereas the punishments
which meet audacious acts promptly are checks against
future offences, and have a sovereign virtue to encourage the
sufferers. Thus I often feel distressed when I recall the saying
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> of Bias. It appears that he told a certain wicked man that he
had no fear of his escaping retribution, he did fear that he himself
might not be there to see. What did the Messenians gain
by the punishment of Aristocrates, when they had been already
slain? He had lost the battle at the Trench<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c006'><sup>[204]</sup></a> by treachery,
reigned over the Arcadians for more than twenty years undiscovered,
and was at last found out and punished, but the Messenians
were no more. What consolation to the Orchomenians,
who had lost children, friends, and kinsmen through the treason
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>of Lyciscus, was the disease which fastened upon him long years
afterwards, and devoured his body? He had once and again
dipped both feet into the river, with prayers and imprecations <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>549<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
as he wetted them, that they might rot away if he had done
any wrong or treachery. At Athens, when the corpses of the
“Accursed” were thrown out, and set beyond the frontier, it
was not possible even for the children’s children of the victims
to see it done. Hence it is strange that Euripides<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c006'><sup>[205]</sup></a> should have
used such thoughts as these to deter men from wickedness:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Justice shall never strike thee to the heart—</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Fear not her footfall—no, nor any man</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>That does the wrong; with silent foot and slow,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>When the day comes, she’ll stalk the sinners down.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The very phrases—are they not?—which bad men might use
to give themselves encouragement and assurance to set hand to
lawless acts, since they show injustice yielding her harvest ripe
and ready, and punishment lagging late and far behind the
enjoyment.’</p>

<p class='c005'>III. When Patrocleas had done, Olympicus spoke next:
‘Take another point, Patrocleas; what a grave absurdity these
delays and hesitations on the part of Heaven involve! The
slowness takes away all assurance of a Providence; and when
misfortune comes to bad men, not on the heels of each wicked <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
deed, but later on, they set it down to mischance, and call it
a calamity, not a punishment; they do not profit by it, they
are annoyed at the things which befall them, but do not repent
of the things which they have done. It is so with a horse; the
touch of whip or spur which follows immediately on a stumble
or blunder sets him up and brings him to his duty; whereas
tugs and checks and ratings later on, after an interval, seem to
him to have some purpose which is not education, they irritate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>but do not school him. And so with vice; if punishment
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> from switch or rein follow every trip and tumble, vice will have
the best chance of becoming thoughtful and lowly, and getting
the fear of God, as of a Judge who stands over men in their acts
and their passions, and does not wait till the day after to-morrow.
Whereas, the Justice which moves calmly, “with a slow foot”,
as Euripides put it, and falls upon the wicked “when the day
comes”, resembles an automaton rather than a Providence, in
her vague, procrastinating, unmethodical procedure. Thus
I do not see what use there is in those “mills of the Gods” which
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “grind slowly”, we are told,<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c006'><sup>[206]</sup></a> for they make the form of Justice
dim, and the fears of the wicked evanescent.’</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. When all this had been said, and while I was deep in
thought, Timon said: ‘Shall I intervene and with my own
hand add the crowning stone of difficulty to our argument, or
shall I allow it first to win through for itself against what we
have already heard?’ ‘What need’, I said, ‘to let in the “third
wave” and sluice the argument anew, if it prove unable to force
aside the first objections and escape them? In the first place,
then, we will start from our own ancestral hearth, from the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> reserve, I mean, which the philosophers of the Academy show
in speaking of what is divine; and reverently clear ourself from
any claim to speak with knowledge about these matters. It is
a graver mistake than for unmusical persons to discuss music, or
civilians a campaign, if we mere men are to scrutinize the things
which belong to Gods and daemons; the inartistic trying to
track the inner thought of the artist, by fanciful and random
conjecture. If it is hard for a layman to guess at the reasoning
which led a doctor to use the knife later and not sooner, or to
apply a lotion to-day and not yesterday, surely it is not easy for
a mortal to speak with any certainty about God, more than this—that
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>530<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> he best knows the proper time for the curative treatment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>of vice, and applies the due punishment, as a medicine, to each
man accordingly; for vice admits of no measure common to all,
the proper time is not the same for every case. That the
medical treatment of the soul which we call “Right” and
“Justice” is of all arts the greatest, we have the testimony of
thousands of witnesses, Pindar<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c006'><sup>[207]</sup></a> among them. He acclaims the
sovereign ruler of all the Gods as “in art most excellent”,
because Justice is of his workmanship, and to her it pertains to
determine the “when” and the “how” and the degree of
punishment for every offender. And Plato<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c006'><sup>[208]</sup></a> tells us that Minos,
who is a son of Zeus, has become a learner of this art; showing
that it is not possible for one who has not learnt, and acquired <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the knowledge, to go straight in questions of right, or to apprehend
the guiding principle. Even the laws which men frame
are not everywhere, and on the face of them, reasonable; some
enactments appear simply ludicrous. In Lacedaemon, for
instance, the Ephors, when they first enter office, make proclamation
that no one is to grow a moustache, and that “men
should obey the laws, that the laws may not be hard upon them”.
The Romans, when they release slaves “into freedom” give
them a tap with a light reed. When they draw a will, they
make one set of persons “heirs” and “sell” the property to
others, which appears strange. Strangest of all is the enactment <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of Solon, that the man who takes neither side in a party contest,
but stands out, should lose the franchise. One might go on to
mention many legal absurdities, where the intention of the
lawyers and the reason of the provisions are out of our knowledge.
Then, if human codes are so inscrutable, what wonder that, in
speaking of the Gods, we cannot lightly lay down the principle
upon which they punish some offenders later, some sooner?</p>

<p class='c005'>V. ‘All this is no pretext for evading the issue; but it is
a plea for indulgence; that the argument, having its harbour of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>refuge in sight, may rear itself confidently from the depths to
meet the difficulty. Now first consider that, as Plato<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c006'><sup>[209]</sup></a> shows,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> God sets himself before us for a pattern of all good things, and
implants in those who are able to follow God that human virtue
which is, in a sort, likeness to himself. For Universal Nature,
while yet unorganized, found the beginning of its change to
a world of order in assimilation to the idea and excellence of
God, and in a measure of participation therein. The same
Plato<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c006'><sup>[210]</sup></a> tells us that Nature kindled in us the sense of sight, in
order that the soul, by gazing in wonder at the bodies which
move through heaven, may become accustomed to welcome
what is shapely and well ordered, to abhor ill-regulated and
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> roving passions, and to eschew, as the origin of all vice and
naughtiness, whatever is random and fortuitous. For man has
no greater natural enjoyment of God than to imitate and pursue
all that in him is fair and good, and so to attain to virtue.
Therefore is God slow and leisurely in inflicting punishment on
the bad, not that he fears mistake on his own part if he punish
quickly, or any repentance; rather he is putting away from us all
brutish vehemence in the punishments we inflict, and teaching
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> us not to choose the moment of heat and agitation, when</p>

<p class='c011'>to spring upon those who have vexed us, as though glutting
a thirst or a hunger; but to copy his own gentleness and long-suffering,
to be orderly and staid when we set our hand to
punishment, taking Time for a counsellor who will never have
Repentance for his consort. For it is a smaller evil, as Socrates
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>551<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> used to say, to drink turbid water in our greediness, when we find
it by the way, than with the reason still muddied, full of wrath
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>and frenzy, before it has settled down and run clear, to glut
ourselves in the punishment of a body which is of one race and
tribe with our own. It is not, as Thucydides would tell us, the
retribution following most closely on the injury received, but
that most remote from it, which really exacts what is its due.
For as temper, according to Melanthius,<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c006'><sup>[212]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>so reason, on the contrary, employs justice and moderation,
setting passion and temper afar. So it is that even human
examples make men gentle, as when we hear that Plato stood
long over his servant with rod uplifted, correcting, as he said <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
himself, his own temper; or, again, as Archytas, informed of
some disorderly behaviour of his workmen in the field, and
feeling himself unusually irritated and harsh, did nothing, but
just said, as he went away, “Well for you that I am feeling
angry.” If sayings like these and anecdotes about men drain
away what is rough and violent in our anger, much more when
we see God, in whom is no fear nor any sort of repentance, yet
reserving punishment and abiding his time, may we well become <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
cautious in such matters, and deem the gentleness and lofty
patience which he exhibits a god-like part of virtue. By his
punishment he corrects a few, by the slowness of his punishment
he helps and admonishes many.</p>

<p class='c005'>VI. ‘Let us now turn our attention to a second point, which
is this: All kinds of human retribution deal out pain for pain
and stop there. “Suffering for the doer”<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c006'><sup>[213]</sup></a> is their principle,
and beyond it they do not go. So they follow sin like a howling
pack which hunts on the heels of the offences. Whereas God, we
may suppose, when he sets his hand to punish a soul that is sick, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
scrutinizes its passions, if perhaps they may be bent aside, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>a way opened to repentance; he fixes a time, in cases where the
wickedness seated within is not absolute or inflexible. He knows
how large a portion of virtue, proceeding from himself, souls
carry with them when they pass to birth, how powerful within
the noble principle naturally is, and how ineffaceable; that it
may flower into vice contrary to nature, when nurture and
company are bad and corrupting, yet is afterwards cured in
some persons and recovers its own proper state. And so he
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> does not bring down punishment equally upon all. What is
incurable he at once removes out of the life and prunes away,
because, happen what may, it is injurious to others, most
injurious of all to a man’s self, to consort with wickedness all his
time. Where the sinful principle may be supposed to exist
through ignorance of the good rather than from deliberate
preference for the base, he gives them time for reformation;
but if they persist, they, too, receive punishment in full; for
he has no fear, we may be sure, lest they escape him at the last.
Now consider how many changes take place in human character
and life. And this is why that in them which changes is called
“tropos” (turning) and “ethos” (<i>ēthos</i>), because habit (<i>ĕthos</i>)
finds its way in so often, and masters them so mightily. I think
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> myself that the ancients called Cecrops “double-shaped”, not,
as some say, because from a good king he became a very dragon
of a tyrant, but, on the contrary, because he was, to begin with,
perverse and terrible, and afterwards became a mild and humane
ruler. This instance may be an uncertain one, but we know
of Gelon at any rate, and Hiero in Sicily, and Pisistratus son of
Hippocrates, how they won power by wickedness, but all used
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>552<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> it virtuously; came to rule through unlawful ways, but turned
out fair and patriotic rulers; introduced the reign of law
and of careful agriculture, found their subjects men of jest
and gossip, and made them sober and industrious. Gelon,
moreover, fought nobly at the head of his people, won a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>battle against the Carthaginians, and refused them a peace
when they sued for one, until he had bound them in a covenant
to give up the practice of sacrificing their children to Cronus.
Then, in Megalopolis, there was a tyrant Lydiadas, who changed <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
his ways in the actual course of his reign, and in disgust with his
own injustice restored to the citizens their laws, and fell
gloriously fighting for the country against its enemies. Suppose
some one had slain Miltiades while tyrant in the Chersonese, as
he first was, or had got a conviction for incest against Cimon,
or had robbed Athens of Themistocles by a prosecution for his
riotous passage through the market-place, as was done with
Alcibiades later on, where would be our Marathons, our
Eurymedons, that noble Artemisium, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c011'>For great natures produce nothing petty; their vehemence and

As then one ignorant of husbandry would not welcome the
prospect of a piece of land full of thick undergrowth and
weeds, with many wild creatures on it, and streams of water,
and deep mud; whereas, to one who has learned to use his senses
and to discriminate, those very things suggest strength and
fatness and everything that is good in the soil, so it is with great
natures. They break out early into many strange bad growths, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
out of which we, in our intolerance, think it our duty to cut away
and stunt all that is rough and prickly; but the Judge who is
better than we and who sees the good and generous crop to
come, waits for Time, the fellow-worker with Reason and Virtue,
and that ripeness whereby Nature yields the proper fruit.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>VII. ‘So much for this. Now do you not think that some
of the Greeks are right in copying the Egyptian law which enacts
that a pregnant woman who has been condemned to death
should be kept in custody until she has borne a child?’ ‘Certainly’,
they said. I went on: ‘Next, suppose a person not
pregnant with children, but able, if time be given, to bring into
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> the light of the sun some secret action or design, either by
denouncing a hidden evil, or by becoming the promoter of
a salutary policy or the inventor of some needful expedient, is it
not the better course to let punishment wait on convenience
rather than to inflict it too soon? It seems to me to be so.’
‘And to us’, said Patrocleas. ‘And rightly,’ said I, ‘for consider
that if Dionysius had paid the penalty at the beginning
of his reign, no Greek settler would have been left in Sicily,
because the Carthaginians would have devastated it. So
neither Apollonia, nor Anactorium, nor the Leucadian peninsula
would have been occupied by Greeks if Periander had
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> been punished without such a long interval. I think that
Cassander also had a respite in order that Thebes might be
re-established. Most of the foreigners who helped to seize this
temple crossed over with Timoleon into Sicily; and when they
had conquered the Carthaginians, and put an end to the
tyrannies, met deservedly miserable deaths themselves. Surely
Heaven uses some bad men to punish others, like executioners,
and afterwards crushes them, and this has been the case, I think,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>553<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> with most tyrants. For as the gall of the hyaena, the refuse of
the seal, and other products of disgusting animals, have their
specific use in disease, so there are some who need the sharp
tooth of chastisement; on whom the God inflicts a bitter and
implacable tyrant, or a harsh rough ruler, and only removes
this torment when he has relieved and purged their ailment.
Such a medicine was Phalaris to the Agrigentines, and Marius
to the Romans. To the Sicyonians the God declared in plain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>terms that their state needed beadles with whips, because they
had taken by force from the men of Cleonae a boy named
Teletias, who was to be crowned at the Pythian games, as being
their own citizen, and torn him in pieces. The Sicyonians got <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Orthagoras for a tyrant, and after him Myron and Cleisthenes,
who put an end to their bad ways, while the Cleonaeans, who
never found such a remedy, have come to nothing. Listen to
Homer,<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c006'><sup>[215]</sup></a> who says somewhere</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet that son of Copreus has left us no brilliant or signal achievement,
while the posterity of Sisyphus and Autolycus and
Phlegyas burst into flower of glory and virtue in the persons
of great kings. Pericles at Athens came of a house which was
under a curse. Pompey the Great, at Rome, was the son of
Strabo, whose corpse the Romans cast out and trampled <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
in their hatred. What is there strange then if God acts like the
farmer, who does not cut down the thistle till he has picked the
asparagus, or like the Libyans who do not burn the dry stalks
before they have collected the gum; who spares to destroy a bad
and rough-grown root of a noble race of kings till the due
fruit has issued from it? For it were better for the Phocians that
Iphitus should lose tens of thousands of cattle and horses, or
that even more gold should leave Delphi, and silver too, than
that Ulysses should never have been born, or Asclepius, or <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the other brave men and mighty benefactors who have come
of bad and vicious lines.</p>

<p class='c005'>VIII. ‘But do you not all think it better that punishments
should fall in the fitting time and manner than hastily and at
once? There is the case of Callippus, who was slain by his
friends with the very dagger which he had used to slay Dion in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>the guise of a friend. Again, there is Mitys<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c006'><sup>[216]</sup></a> of Argos, killed in
a party quarrel, whose brazen statue in the market-place fell on
the murderer during a public performance and killed him.

and Ariston of Oeta, the commander of foreign troops?’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> ‘Indeed I do not,’ he replied, ‘but I want to hear.’ ‘Ariston,’
I said, ‘with the consent of the tyrants, took down the ornaments
of Eriphyle, deposited here, and carried them off to his wife
for a present. Then his son, enraged with his mother for
some reason, set fire to the house, and burnt up all who were
within it. Bessus, it appears, slew his own father, and for
a long time escaped detection. Afterwards, having come to
some friends for supper, he put his spear through a swallows’
nest and brought it down, and destroyed the young birds. All
present exclaimed, as well they might: “Man, what has
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> possessed you to do such a monstrous thing?” To which he
replied: “Have they not been telling lies against me this long
time, shrieking that I have killed my father?” Astonished at
such a speech, they informed the king, an inquiry was held, and
Bessus suffered.</p>

<p class='c011'>The corn-beetle is said to carry in herself an antidote compounded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>on a principle of opposites, but wickedness as it grows
breeds its own pain and punishment, and suffers the penalty,
not by and by, but in the very moment of insolence. In the
body, every criminal who is punished<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c006'><sup>[219]</sup></a> carries forth his own <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
cross; but vice fabricates for herself, out of herself, all the
instruments of her chastisement; she manufactures a terrible
life, piteous and shameful, with terrors and cruel pains, with
regrets and troubles unceasing. But there are persons just like
children, who see evildoers on the stage crowned and caparisoned,
as often happens, in gold and purple, and dancing heartily; and
gape and gaze, as though these men were happy indeed; until
they are seen goaded and lashed, and fire issuing out of those
gay and costly robes. Most bad men are wrapped as in a vesture <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of great houses, and eminent offices and powers; and so it is
unperceived that they are being punished, until, before you can
think, they are stabbed or hurled down a rock, which is not to
be called punishment, but the end or consummation of punishment.
For as Herodicus of Selymbria, who fell into a hopeless
decline, and, for the first time in human history, combined
gymnastics with medicine, made death, in Plato’s<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c006'><sup>[220]</sup></a> words, “a long
affair for himself”, and for similar invalids, so has it been with
bad men. They thought to escape the blow at the time; the
penalty comes, not after more time, but over more time, and is
lengthened, not retarded. They were not punished after they <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
came to old age, but became old under punishment. I speak of
length of time in a sense relative to ourselves, since to the
Gods any span of human life is as nothing. “Now”, instead
of “thirty years ago”, for the torture or hanging of a criminal,
is as though we were to speak of “afternoon” not “morning”;
the rather that he is confined in life, a prison where is no change
of place, no escape, yet many feastings the while, and business
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>affairs, and gifts, and bounties, and amusements, just as men play
dice or draughts in jail, with the rope hanging over their heads.</p>

<p class='c005'>X. ‘Yet where are we to stop? Are we to say that prisoners
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> awaiting execution are not under punishment until the axe shall
fall? Nor he who has drunk the hemlock, and is walking about
while he waits to feel the heaviness in the legs which precedes the
chill and stiffness of approaching insensibility? Yet we must say
so, if we think that the last moment of the punishment is the
punishment, and leave out of account the sufferings of the
intervening time, the fears, and forebodings, and movements of
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> remorse, in which every sinner is involved. This would be like
saying that a fish when he has swallowed the hook has not been
caught until he has been roasted by the cook, or at least sliced
up, before our eyes. Every man is in the grasp of Justice
when he has done a wrong, he has nibbled away the sweets of
Injustice which are the bait; but he has the hook of conscience
sticking there and, as it pays him out,<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c006'><sup>[221]</sup></a></p>

dealing out large helpings of flesh to his enemies. Pausanias
had wickedly sent for Cleonice at Byzantium, a maiden of free

<p class='c011'>When the phantom never ceased to trouble him, he sailed, as it
appears, to Heracleia, where is the Place of Summons of Souls,
and with soothing rites and libations set himself to call up the
soul of the girl; she appeared to him and told him that he
“will cease from his troubles when he reaches Lacedaemon”;
and, directly he got there, he died.<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c006'><sup>[224]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>XI. ‘Then, if nothing remains for the soul after death, but <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
death is a limit beyond which is neither grace nor punishment,
we should rather say that bad men who are punished quickly, and
who die off, are used gently and indulgently by Heaven. For if
it could be held that there is no other evil for the bad while life
and time last, yet even so, when injustice is tried and proved
an unfruitful, thankless business, which yields no return for
many and great struggles, the mere sense of these upsets the
soul. You will remember the story of Lysimachus, how, under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> great stress of thirst, he surrendered himself and his power to
the Getae, and, when now their prisoner, said as he drank:
“Wretch that I am, for so brief a pleasure to have lost so great
a kingdom!” And yet to resist the physical compulsion of
appetite is very hard. But when a man, by grasping at money,
or in envy of political reputation and power, or for the pleasure
of some union, has wrought a lawless dreadful deed, and afterwards,
when the thirst or frenzy of passion has left him, sees, as
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> time goes on, the disgrace and terror of iniquity becoming
permanent, with nothing useful, or necessary, or delightful
gained, then is it not natural that he should often reckon up
and feel how hollow is the glory, how ignoble and thankless the
pleasure, for which he has upset all that is greatest and noblest in
human codes of right, and filled his own life with shame and
confusion? Simonides<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c006'><sup>[225]</sup></a> used to say in jest that he found the
chest of silver always full, but that of gratitude empty; and so
bad men, when they look into the wickedness within them, find
that, through the pleasure which has a short-lived return, it is
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>556<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> left void of hope, but filled to the brim with fears and pains and
joyless memory, with suspicion of the future, and distrust of the
present. So Ino on the stage,<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c006'><sup>[226]</sup></a> when she is repenting of what
she has done:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>

      <div class='line'><i>I had done nothing of the deeds I did?</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Such thoughts we may suppose that the soul of every bad man
rakes up within itself, while it calculates how it may escape
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> from the memory of its misdoings, and cast out conscience,
and become pure, and lead another life as from the beginning.
There is no confidence, nothing free from caprice, nothing
permanent or solid, in the designs of wickedness, unless, save
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>the mark! we are to call wicked-doers philosophers of a sort!
But where love of wealth or pleasure, as of great prizes, and envy
undiluted, are lodged by the side of hate and ill-temper, there,
if you look deep, you will find superstition seated, and softness
to meet toil, and cowardice to meet death, and a rapid shifting
of impulses, and a vain-gloriousness which comes of arrogance.
They fear those who censure them, and equally fear those who <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
praise, as being victims whom they have deceived, and who are
the bitterest enemies of the bad, just because they praise so
heartily those whom they take to be good. For hardness in
vice, as in bad steel, is unsound, its rigidity is soon broken.
Hence more and more, as time goes on, they discover their own
condition; they are vexed and discontented, and spurn their
own life away. We see that a bad man, when he has restored

subscription or a contribution which brings him glory and
credit, is immediately seized with repentance, and grieves at <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
what he has done, so shifty and unsettled is his judgement.
We see others when applauded in the theatre at once groaning
inwardly, as ambition subsides into greed of money. And
did not, think you, those who sacrificed men to get a tyranny,
or to advance a conspiracy, as Apollodorus did, or who robbed
their friends of money, as Glaucus the son of Epicydes
did, repent, and hate themselves, and suffer pain at what had
been done? For my own part, if I may be allowed to say so,
I think that the doers of unholy deeds need no God nor man to
punish them; their own life is sufficient, when ruined by vice,
and thrown into all disorder. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c005'>XII. ‘But keep an eye on the discussion,’ I said, ‘for it may
be running out beyond our limits.’ ‘Perhaps it is,’ said Timon,
‘if we look on, and consider the length of what remains to be
said. For now I am going to call up the final difficulty, as
a champion who has been standing out, since those which came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>forward first have pretty well had their round out. Turn to
the charge so boldly thrown at the Gods by Euripides,<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c006'><sup>[227]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>and take it that we too who have so far been silent adopt his
arraignment. If, on the one hand, the doers paid the penalty
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> themselves, then there is no need to punish those who did no
wrong, seeing that justice does not allow even the doers to be
punished twice for the same offences. If, on the other, the Gods,
out of indolence, have allowed the punishment to drop, as
against the wicked, and then exact it late in the day from the
guiltless, the set-off of tardiness against injustice is all wrong.
You will remember the story of what happened to Aesop in
this place; how he came with gold from Croesus, to sacrifice
to the God magnificently, and make a distribution among the
Delphians, four minae apiece. There was some angry difference,
it appears, between him and the brotherhood; so he
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>556<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> performed the sacrifice, but sent the money back to Sardis,
judging the men unworthy of the bounty. They worked up
a charge of sacrilege against him, thrust him down from the
rock called Hyampeia, and killed him. Then, in his wrath at
this, the God brought sterility on their land, and every form
of strange disease; so that they went round the Assemblies of
the Greeks asking by repeated proclamation that any who chose
to come forward should punish them on Aesop’s behalf. In
the third generation, Iadmon,<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c006'><sup>[228]</sup></a> a Samian, came, no blood
relation of Aesop, but a descendant of those who had bought
him at Samos; and to him they paid certain penalties, and
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> were set free from their troubles. From that time the punishment
of sacrilegious criminals was transferred to Nauplia from
Hyampeia. Not even those most devoted to Alexander, among
whom we reckon ourselves, commend him for throwing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>city of Branchidae into ruins, and putting its inhabitants to the
sword, because of the treacherous surrender by their forefathers
of the temple at Miletus. Then Agathocles, tyrant of Syracuse,
derided with open laughter the Corcyraeans who asked “why
he plundered their island?” “Because, of course,” he said,
“your fathers sheltered Ulysses.” And, in like manner, when the
Ithacans complained of his soldiers taking their sheep, “Why, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
your king”, he said, “came to us, and blinded the shepherd
too!”<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c006'><sup>[229]</sup></a> Now is it not even more monstrous of Apollo to destroy
the Pheneatae<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c006'><sup>[230]</sup></a> of the present day, by blocking the pit which
took their water, and deluging all their land, because, a thousand
years ago, as the story goes, Hercules snatched away the prophetic
tripod and brought it to Pheneus? And what of his
promise to the Sybarites of release from their troubles when
they should have propitiated the wrath of the Leucadian Hera
“by three destructions”? Again, it is not long since the <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>

reasonableness and justice here? Certainly we do not praise the
Thracians, because they still brand their own wives to avenge
Orpheus, or the Barbarians living about the Eridanus for wearing
black, in mourning for Phaethon as they say. It would have
been still more ridiculous, I think, if the men living when
Phaethon perished thought nothing about it, and then those <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
born five generations or ten generations after the sad occurrence
began to change into mourning clothes for him! Yet there is
nothing but stupidity in that, nothing terrible or beyond cure;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>but the angers of the Gods pass underground at the time, like

<p class='c011'>in honoured memory of old Terpander, for the case is the same.
But I appeal to you, who claim, as I understand, precedence
among the Boeotians as Opheltiadae, and among the Phocians
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> because of Daiphantus; and who stood by me formerly, when,
speaking in support of the claim of the Lycormae and Satilaeans
through their ancestor to receive the honour and wear the crown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>due to the Heraclidae, I argued that those sprung of Hercules
had the strongest right to be confirmed in the honours and
prizes, because their ancestor received no worthy prize or
return for his good deeds to the Greeks.’ ‘And a noble contention
it was,’ he said, ‘and worthy indeed of Philosophy!’
‘Then pray drop’, I said, ‘that vehement tone in your arraignment,
and do not make it any grievance that some born of bad
or vicious ancestors are punished; or else never rejoice or
applaud in the other case, when noble birth is honoured. For <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
if the gratitude due to virtue is to be kept active for the benefit
of the family, it is logical and right also that the punishment for
crimes should never be exhausted or fail, but should run a parallel
course, so that payment should follow deserts under either head.
Any one who finds pleasure in seeing honour done to the
descendants of Cimon at Athens, but makes it a grievance that
those of Lachares or Ariston are banished, is too soft and too
careless, or, as I would rather say, is quarrelsome and captious in
all his attitude to Heaven. He challenges, if the children of
an unjust and evil man appear to prosper, and he challenges if
the families of the bad are abased or extinguished; he blames <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the God equally if the children of a good father are in trouble,
or of a bad one.</p>

<p class='c005'>XIV. ‘There,’ I said, ‘let all this serve for so many dykes
or barriers against those bitter and aggressive assailants!
Now, let us go back, and pick up the end of the thread in this
dark place with its windings and wanderings; I mean our argument
about the God. Let us guide ourselves with quiet caution
towards what is likely and reasonable, since certainty and truth
are beyond us, even as to our own actions. For instance, why
do we order the children of persons who have died of consumption <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
or dropsy to sit with both feet dipped into water until the
corpse is consumed? The idea seems to be that, if this is done,
the disease does not shift its seat or approach them. Or again,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>why is it that, if one goat have taken the herb eryngium<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c006'><sup>[234]</sup></a> into
her mouth, the whole flock halts until the goatherd comes and
takes it out? And there are other occult properties, with ways,
whether of contact or of dissemination, by which they pass,
with incredible speed and over incredible intervals, through
one to another. Yet we find intervals of time wonderful, but
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> not those of place; although it is really more wonderful that
a disease which began in Aethiopia<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c006'><sup>[235]</sup></a> infected Athens, where
Pericles died and Thucydides took it, than that, when Delphians
and Sybarites had been wicked, the punishment circled round
to attack their children. There is correspondence of forces from
last to first, and there are connecting links, the cause of which,
unknown, it may be, to us, produces in silence its proper effect.<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c006'><sup>[236]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>XV. ‘Not but that the public visitations of cities by the
wrath of Heaven can be readily accounted for on the score of
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>559<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> justice. A city is a thing one and continuous, like an animal,
which does not cease to be itself in the changes due to growth,
nor become, as time goes on, different from what it was; it
is always consentaneous and at one with itself, and awaits all
the consequences, whether censure or gratitude, of what it
does or did, so long as the association, which makes it one and
complex, preserves its unity. To divide it, according to time,
into many cities, or, rather, into an infinite number of them, is
like making many men out of one, because he is now elderly,
was formerly younger, and, still further back, was a boy. Or
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> rather, the whole idea is like those tricks of Epicharmus out of
which the “Increasing Fallacy” of the Sophists sprang. The
man who formerly received the loan does not own it now, for
he has become a different person. The man who was asked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>to dinner yesterday, comes an unbidden guest to-day, for he
is some one else. Yet the stages of growth produce greater
variations in each one of ourselves than they do in cities as
wholes. Any one who had seen Athens thirty years ago would
recognize it to-day; manners, movements, amusements, business,
popular gratitude, and resentments, all quite as of old.
Whereas a man would hardly be recognized in figure by friend
or relation who should meet him after an interval, while the
changes in character so easily produced by anything—a word, an <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
exertion, a feeling, a law—produce an effect of strangeness and
novelty even to one always in his company. Yet he is spoken
of as one man from birth to the end; and we insist that a city,
which remains the same in exactly the same sense, is liable for
the reproaches incurred by ancestors, by the same title as it
claims their reputation and power. Otherwise we shall have
everything, before we know it, in the river of Heraclitus,<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c006'><sup>[237]</sup></a> which
he says a man cannot enter twice, because Nature disturbs and
alters all things in her own changes.</p>

<p class='c005'>XVI. ‘But if a city is a thing one and continuous, I take
it that a family also depends from a single origin which assures <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
a certain pervading force of association. An offspring is never
separated from its begetter, as is a piece of man’s handicraft;
it has been made out of him, not by him; thus it has in itself
some permanent portion of him, and whether it be punished or
honoured, receives what is its due. If it were not that I might
seem to trifle, I would say that graver injustice was done to
the statue of Cassander when it was melted down by the Athenians,
and to the corpse of Dionysius when it was thrust out
beyond the frontier by the Syracusans, than to the descendants
of those men in the punishments which they received. For there
is nothing of the nature of Cassander in the statue, and the soul <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of Dionysius has quitted the corpse; whereas in Nisaeus, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>Apollocrates, and Antipater and Philip, and similarly in the
other sons of bad men, the determining part of their parents is
inborn in them, and is there; it is not quiescent or inactive,
since by it they live and are nourished, are directed, and think.
There is nothing strange or remarkable if, being of them, they
have what was theirs. In a word, as in Medicine, what is
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> serviceable is also just. It is ridiculous to talk of the injustice
of cauterizing the thumb when the pain is in the hip, or
scarifying the region of the stomach for a tumour inside the
liver, or of oiling the ends of the horns of cattle, if there is
softening of the hoofs. So it is with punishments; to think
that there is any other justice than what heals the mischief,
or to be indignant if the treatment be applied to one set of
persons through another set (as in opening a vein to relieve
weak eyes) is to see nothing beyond the range of sense, to fail
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>560<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> to remember that a schoolmaster who chastises one boy
teaches a lesson to many boys, and that a general who executes
one man in ten, brings all to their duty. And thus not only one
part through another part, but also soul through soul receives
certain dispositions, be they of deterioration or amendment,
in a truer sense than body through body. In the case of body,
the affection arising must be the same, and the alteration
produced must be the same; whereas soul is led by its own
imaginings in the way of assurance or fear, and so becomes
permanently worse or else better.’</p>

<p class='c005'>XVII. While I was still speaking, Olympicus broke in:
‘It seems to me’, he said, ‘that your argument relies on a great
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> fundamental assumption—the permanence of the soul.’ ‘Subject
to your consent, it does,’ I replied, ‘or rather to your
consent already given; for, from the initial supposition that
God dispenses to us according to our deserts, the discussion
has proceeded to its present stage.’ ‘Then’, he said, ‘you think
that, because the Gods survey and administer all our affairs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>it follows that our souls are either wholly imperishable, or,
permanent for a certain time after death.’ ‘Oh no! good
friend,’ I said, ‘but the God is so petty, so important a trifler,
that, dealing with men like us, who have nothing in us
divine or like him in any way, or persistent, or solid, but who
wither away altogether “like leaves”, as Homer<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c006'><sup>[238]</sup></a> said, and <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
perish within a short span, he makes us of so great account!
That would be like the gardens of Adonis which women nurse
and tend in crockery pots; souls of a day springing up within
a pampered flesh wherein no strong living root finds room, and
then at once snuffed out on the first pretext. But, if you will,
let the other Gods be, and look at our own God here. Knowing
that the souls of those who die perish at once, like mists or
smoke-wreaths exhaled from the bodies, does he, think you,
require men to bring so many propitiations for the departed, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and such great honours to the dead, deceiving and tricking
his believers? For myself, I will never give up the permanence
of the soul, unless some one like Hercules shall come, and remove
the tripod of the Pythia, and lay waste the place of the oracles.
But in our own time so long as many such prophecies are given
as once were delivered to Corax the Naxian, it is nothing less
than impious to condemn the soul to death.’ Here Patrocleas
asked: ‘But what was the prophecy delivered, and who was
this Corax? The fact and the name are equally strange to <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
me.’ ‘Not at all,’ I said, ‘the fault is mine for using a by-name
instead of the real one. The man who killed Archilochus in
battle was called Calondas, it appears; Corax was a by-name
given to him. Turned out, at first, by the Pythia, as having
slain a man sacred to the Muses, then, having put in a plea
of justification, accompanied by prayers and supplications,
he was ordered to go to the “dwelling of Tettix” and propitiate
the soul of Archilochus. This place was Taenarus; for thither,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>they say, Tettix the Cretan went with an expedition, and
there he founded a city, and dwelt near the “Place of the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Passage of Souls”. So, when the Spartans had been ordered
to propitiate the soul of Pausanias, the “Conductors of Souls”
were sent for out of Italy, and, after having done sacrifice,
ousted the ghost from the temple.</p>

<p class='c005'>XVIII. ‘Thus’, I continued, ‘the argument which assures
the Providence of God and also the permanence of the human
soul, is one only; it is impossible to remove either and to keep
the other. But if the soul exists after death, it becomes more
probable that a requital is made to it in full both of honours
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>561<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> and of punishments. Like an athlete, it is engaged in a contest
during life; the contest done, it then receives in its own self all
its due. However, what rewards or what chastisements it there
receives in its own self, are nothing to us that are alive, they are
disbelieved or are unmarked. But those which pass through
children or family are manifest to those who are here, and turn
away many bad men and pull them up short. But to prove that
there is no more disgraceful and grievous punishment than
for a man to see his own descendants suffering on his account;
and that when the soul of an offender against piety or law
looks after death, and sees, not the overthrow of statues or
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> memorials effaced, but sons or friends or kinsmen involved in
great misfortunes, all because of itself, and paying its penalties,
it could not be content, no, not for all the honours which
are given to Zeus, to become a second time unjust and
profligate, I can tell you a story which I have lately heard;
yet I hesitate lest it may appear to you a myth, so I confine
myself to showing the probability.’ ‘On no account!’ said
Olympicus, ‘give us the whole of that story too.’ As the
others made the same petition, ‘Let me make good’, said I,
‘the probability of the view, then we will start the myth, if
myth indeed it be.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>XIX. ‘Now Bion says that it would be more ridiculous <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
if God were to punish the sons of wicked men, than for a doctor
to drug a descendant or a son for the disease of a grandfather
or a father. But the cases are dissimilar in one respect, though
closely alike in another. The treatment of one person does not
relieve another from disease; no patient with eye disease or
fever was ever the better for seeing an ointment or a plaster
applied to another. The punishments of the wicked are
exhibited to all, because the effect of the reasonable operation
of justice is to restrain some through the punishment of others.
But the point of resemblance between the parallel adduced <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
by Bion and our problem he failed to observe; it is this: when
a man has fallen into a sickness which is bad but not incurable,
and afterwards through intemperance and self-indulgence has
surrendered his body to the malady and has died of it, then,
if there be a son, not evidently diseased but only with a tendency
to the same disease, a physician, or relative, or trainer, or a kind
master who has learnt the state of the case, will put him upon
a strict diet and remove made dishes and drinks and women,
and use regular courses of physic, and harden his body by
exercises, and will thus disperse and expel the symptoms, and <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
not allow the little seed of a great trouble to reach any size.
Is not that the tone which we adopt, entreating sons of fathers
or mothers with a tendency to diseases to pay attention to
themselves, and to watch out, and not be careless, but to get
rid at once of the first beginnings in the system, taking them in
time while they are easy to move and loosely seated?’ ‘It
is indeed’, they said. ‘Then we are doing nothing out of
place, but a necessary act, one which is useful and not ludicrous,
when we introduce the sons of epileptic or bilious or gouty
sires to gymnastic exercise, diet, and drugs, not when they are <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
suffering from a disease but in order that they may not take
it; for a body which proceeds out of a vitiated body deserves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>no punishment but rather medical care and watching; if any
one in his cowardice and softness chooses to miscall that punishment,
because it removes pleasures and applies the sharp prick
of pain and trial, we have nothing more to say to him. Now
then, does a body, the issue of a faulty body, deserve treatment
and care, and yet we must endure to see the likeness of a kinsman’s
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>562<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> vice springing up within a young character, and making its
growth there, and to wait until it be spread over his system
and manifest itself in his passions,</p>

<p class='c011'>meaning that the act of generation admits not only of vice
and virtue, but also of grief and joy and the rest, and therefore
he would bring men cheerful and pleasant and open-hearted
to the task? But the other matter does not come out of
Hesiod, nor is it the effect of human wisdom, but of the God,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> to see through likenesses and differences of temperament,
before they stand revealed by a plunge through the passions
into great crimes. For the cubs of bears while still tiny, and the
young of wolves and apes, show at once the character of their
kind, there is no disguise or pretence; but the nature of man
is plunged at once into customs and rules and laws, and often
conceals the bad points and imitates the good, so that the
inborn stain of vice is entirely effaced and removed, or else
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>is undetected for a long time; it assumes a sheath or cloke of <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
cleverness, which we fail to see through. We perceive the
wickedness with an effort each time that the blow or prick of
the several misdoings touches us. In a word, we think that
men become unjust when they commit an injustice, become
intemperate when they do a violence, become cowardly when
they run away. It is as though we should think that the
scorpion grows a sting when he strikes, or vipers their venom
when they bite, which would be simple indeed! Take any
single bad man, he does not become bad when he appears
bad; he has the vice from the first, but it comes out as he gets
opportunity and power, the thief, of thieving, the born tyrant,
of forcing the laws. But God, by his own nature, apprehends <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
soul better than body; and we may be sure that he is neither
ignorant of the disposition and nature of each, nor waits to
punish violence of the hands, or insolence of the tongue, or
profligacy of the body. For he has himself suffered no wrong;
is not angry with the robber because he has met with violence,
does not hate the profligate because he has been assaulted;
but, as a remedial measure, he often chastises the man whose
tendency is to adulterous crime, or to greed, or to injustice,
thus destroying vice before it has taken hold, as he might an
epilepsy.</p>

<p class='c005'>XXI. ‘Yet we were indignant a little while ago, that the
wicked are punished so late and so slowly. And now we complain <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
because God sometimes cuts short the habit and disposition
before any wrong is done, not knowing that the thing to come
is often worse and more alarming than the thing done, what
is hidden than what is apparent, and unable to calculate the
reasons why it is better to leave some alone even after they have
committed an offence, and to be beforehand with others who
are still meditating one; exactly as drugs are of no use for
certain persons when sick, but are of service to others who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>are not actually sick, but are in a state still more dangerous.

<p class='c011'>If a good son be born of a bad sire, as a healthy child of a sickly
parent, he is relieved from the penalty of race, saved by adoption
out of vice. But the young man who throws back to the
likeness of a tainted race ought, surely, to take to the debts on
his inheritance, that is, to the punishment due to wickedness.
Antigonus was not punished because of Demetrius, nor—to
go back to the heroes of old—Phyleus for Augeas, nor Nestor
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>563<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> for Neleus. These all came of bad sires, but were good. But
where natural disposition has embraced and adopted the family
failing, in those cases Justice pursues and visits to the uttermost
the likeness in vice. For as warts and spots and moles of parents
disappear in their children, but return on the persons of
grandchildren; as again a Greek woman had borne a black
child, and when charged with adultery, discovered that she
was of Ethiopian parentage in the fourth degree; and as, yet
again, out of the sons of Nisibeus, lately dead, who was reported
to be related to the “Sown Men” of Thebes, one reproduced
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> the mark of a spear on his body—family likeness re-emerging
from the depths, after such long intervals—, even so it is often
the case that characteristics and affections of the soul are concealed
and submerged in the early generations, but afterwards
break out again in later individuals, and Nature restores the
familiar type, for vice or for virtue.’</p>

<p class='c005'>XXII. When I had spoken thus I remained silent. Olympicus
laughed quietly, and said: ‘We are not applauding
you, lest we should seem to be letting you off the myth, as
though the demonstration of your view were sufficient without
it; when we have heard it, we will give judgement.’ So I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>went on to tell them: ‘Thespesius of Soli, a kinsman and friend
of that Protogenes who has been with us here, after an early life <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of great profligacy, quickly ran through his fortune, changed his
ways perforce, and took to the pursuit of wealth; when he had
the usual experience of the profligates who do not keep their wives
when they have them, but cast them away and try wrongfully
to get their favours when united to other men. He stopped at
nothing disgraceful if it led to enjoyment or gain, and in a short
time got together an inconsiderable fortune and a mighty
reputation for evil. What hit him hardest was an answer <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
delivered to him by the oracle of Amphilochus. It appears that
he had sent to ask the God “whether he will do better the
rest of his life?”<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c006'><sup>[242]</sup></a> The answer was that he “will live better when
he has died”. And sure enough this, in a way, so fell out not
long afterwards. He fell over from a high place, upon his head;
there was no wound, but he appeared to die of the mere blow,
and on the third day, at the very time of the funeral, revived. He
quickly recovered his strength, and came to himself, and the
change of life which followed was incredible. For the Cilicians
know of no man more fair in all business relations, or more
holy in religious duties, so formidable a foe or so faithful a friend. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Hence those who were brought into contact with him were
very curious to hear the cause of the difference, thinking that
a character so completely remodelled must have been the result
of no trifling experience. And so it truly was, according to
the story related by him to Protogenes, and other equally
considerate friends. For, when sentience left his body, he felt
affected by a change, as a helmsman might do when first
plunged overboard into the depth of the sea; then, recovering
a little, he seemed to himself to breathe all over and to look
around, while his soul opened like one great eye. But he saw <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
nothing of what he had been seeing before, only stars of vast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>size, at infinite distances from one another, each emitting
a ray of marvellous colour and of a tonic force, so that the soul,
riding smoothly on the light, as though over a calm sea, was
carried easily and quickly in every direction. Passing over
most of the sights he saw, he said that the souls of those who
die make a flame-like bubble where the air parts as they rise
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>564<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> from below, then the bubble quickly bursts, and they emerge
with human form but light in bulk, with a movement which
is not the same for all. Some bound forth with marvellous
agility, and dart upwards in a straight line, while others whirl
round together like spindles, now with an upward tendency,
now a downward, borne on by a mingled confused agitation,
which after a very long time, and then with difficulty,
is reduced to calm. Most of them he did not recognize,
but seeing two or three persons of his acquaintance, he tried
to approach them and speak. They would not hear him, and
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> appeared not to be themselves, but to be distraught and scared
out of their senses, shunning all sight or touch, while they
roamed about, first by themselves; then they would meet
and embrace others in like case, and whirl round in random
indefinite figures of every sort, uttering unmeaning sounds,
like cries of battle mingled with those of lamentation and
terror. Others above, on the extremity of the firmament,
were cheerful to behold, often drawing near to one another
in kindness, and turning away from those other turbid souls;
and they would signify, as it seemed, their annoyance by
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> out drawing close together, but joy and affability by opening
and dispersing. There he saw, he said, the soul of a kinsman, but
not very certainly, for the man had died while he was himself
a child. However, the soul drew towards him, and said, “Hail
Thespesius!” He was surprised at this, and said that his name
was not Thespesius, but Aridaeus. “Formerly so,” was the
reply, “but from now Thespesius. For you are not really dead,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>but, by some appointment of Heaven, have come hither with
your sentient part, the rest of your soul is left within the body,
as a light anchor. Let this be a sign to you now and hereafter;
the souls of the dead make no shadow, and their eyes do not <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
blink.”<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c006'><sup>[243]</sup></a> When Thespesius heard this, he drew himself together
in deeper thought, and as he gazed, he saw a sort of dim and
shadowy line which wavered as he moved, while the others were
transparent within, all set around with brightness, yet not all
equally. Some were like the full moon at her purest, and emitted
one smooth, continuous, uniform colour; over others there ran
scales, so to call them, or slender weals; others were quite dappled
and strange to look upon, branded with black spots like those
on serpents; others again showed open blunted scars. Then <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the kinsman of Thespesius (for nothing forbids us to designate
the souls in this way by the names of men) began to explain
it all to him, as thus: “Adrasteia, daughter of Zeus and
Necessity, has been appointed to punish all crimes in the highest
place; no criminal has there ever yet been, so small or so great,
as to pass unseen or to escape by his might. But there are three
modes of punishment, and each mode has its proper guardian
minister. Some men are punished, at once in the body and
through their body, and these swift Retribution handles; her <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
method is a gentle one, and passes over many crimes which ask
for expiation. Those whose cure is a heavier matter are passed
after death to Justice by the daemon. The wholly incurable
Justice rejects; and these the third, and the fiercest, of the
satellites of Adrasteia, whose name is Erinnys, chases, as they
wander and try to escape in all directions; and it is pitiful
and cruel how she brings them all to nothing and plunges
them into the gulf which is beyond speech or sight. As to the <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>565<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
other two modes of justification,” he went on, “that which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>wrought by Retribution during life resembles the usage of
barbarian countries. For as in Persia they pluck off and scourge
the robes and the hats of men under punishment, while their
owners implore them to stop, so punishments through money
or upon the person get no close grip, they do not fasten on
the vice itself, but are mostly for appearance and appeal to
the senses. But whoever makes his way here from earth
unchastened and unpurged, Justice firmly seizes him, with his
soul naked and manifest, having no place into which to skulk,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> that he may hide and veil his wickedness, but eyed from all
sides, and by all, and all over. And first she shows him to good
parents, if such he has, or to ancestors, a contemptible and
unworthy sight. If these are all bad, he sees them punished
and is seen by them, and so is justified during a long time,
while each of his passions is dislodged by pains and toils, which
as much exceed in greatness and intensity those which are through
the flesh, as a day dream may be clearer than that which comes
in sleep. Scars and weals left by particular passions<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c006'><sup>[244]</sup></a> are more
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> persistent in some men than in others. And look”, he said,
“at those motley colours upon the souls, which come from every
source. There is the dusky, dirty red, which is the smear
made by meanness and greed; the fiery blood-red of cruelty
and harshness. Where you see the bluish grey, there intemperance
in pleasures has been rubbed away, and a heavy work
it was; malice and envying have been there to inject that
violet beneath the skin, as cuttle-fishes their ink. For down
on earth vice brings out the colours, while the soul is turned
about by the passions and turns the body, but here, when
these have been smoothed away, the final result of purgation,
and chastisement is this, that the soul becomes radiant all over
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> and of one hue. But as long as the colours are in it, there are
certain reversions to passion, with throbbings and a pulsation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>which in some is faint and easily passes off, in others makes
vigorous resistance. Of these souls, some, being chastised
again and again, attain their fitting habit and disposition;
others are transferred into the bodies of beasts by masterful
ignorance and the passionate love of pleasure;<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c006'><sup>[245]</sup></a> for ignorance,
through weakness of the reasoning part and inactivity of
the speculative, inclines on its practical side towards generation;
while the love of pleasure, requiring an instrument for intemperance, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
craves to unite the desires with their satisfaction,
and to have share in corporeal excitement, since here is nothing
save a sort of ineffectual shadow, and a dream of pleasure
without its fulfilment.” Having said this, he began to lead
him on, moving rapidly yet covering, as it seemed, a space of
infinite extent with unfaltering ease, borne upwards on the
rays of light, as though by wings, until he reached a great
chasm which yawned downwards. There he was deserted by
the supporting force, and saw the other souls in the same case.
Packing together, like birds, and borne down and around, they <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
circled about the chasm, which they did not venture to cross
outright. You might see it within, resembling the caves of
Bacchus, dressed in wood and greenery, and gay with blossoms
of flowers of every sort; and it exhaled a mild and gentle
breeze which wafted odours of marvellous delight, and produced
such an atmosphere as wine throws off for its votaries; for the
souls feasted on the fragrant smells and were relaxed into mutual
kindliness. All around a bacchic humour prevailed, and laughter,
and every joy which the Muses can give where men sport and are
merry. By this way, he said, Dionysus went up to the Gods, and <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>566<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
afterwards brought Semele; it is called “the Place of Lethe”.
Here he did not allow Thespesius to linger, even though
he would, but kept drawing him away by force, explaining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>to him as he did so that the sentient mind becomes wasted and
sodden by pleasure, while the irrational and corporeal part is
watered and pampered and suggests recollection of the body,
and, from that recollection, a yearning and desire which makes
for generation (genesis), so named because it is a leaning towards
earth (Ge-neusis)<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c006'><sup>[246]</sup></a> when the soul is weighed down by moisture.
Having travelled another journey as long as the first, he seemed
to be gazing into a mighty bowl, with rivers discharging into
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> it, one whiter than foam of the sea, or snowflakes, another
with the purple flush of the rainbow, others tinged with
different hues. From a distance each showed its proper ray,
but as he drew near the rim became invisible, and the
colouring was dulled, and the more brilliant hues deserted
the bowl, leaving only the whiteness. And there he saw three
daemons seated close together in a triangle, mingling the streams
in certain measures. Now the soul-conductor of Thespesius
told him that thus far Orpheus advanced, when he was questing
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> for the soul of his wife, and, from not rightly remembering,
put out an untrue account among men, namely that “there
was an oracle at Delphi, held by Apollo and Night in common,
whereas Night has nothing in common with Apollo. Really,”
he said, “this oracle is shared by Night and the moon, having
nowhere an earthly bound, or a single habitation, but roaming
over men everywhere in dreams and phantoms. From here
it is that dreams, which are mingled, as you see, with what is
deceitful and embroidered, get so much simplicity and truth
as they scatter abroad. The oracle of Apollo”, he continued,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> “you have not seen, nor will you ever be able to see it, for the
earthly element of the soul does not mount upwards or allow
that; it is attached closely to the body and bends downwards.”
And as he spoke, he led him on, and he tried to show him the
light coming, as he said, from the tripod, resting on Parnassus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>between the breasts of Themis. Earnestly desiring to see, he
saw nothing for the brightness. But he heard, as he passed,
a woman’s shrill voice chanting in verse many things, among
them the time of his own death. The daemon told him that
the voice was that of the Sibyl,<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c006'><sup>[247]</sup></a> who was singing about things
to be, as she was carried round on the face of the moon. He <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
desired to hear more, but was thrust off by the whirling of the
moon to the opposite side, as though caught in the eddies, and
only heard scraps, one of which was about Mount Vesuvius and
the future destruction by fire of Dicaearcheia, and a fragment
of song about the emperor of that day, how that</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>After that, they turned to the sight of those under punishment.
At first they met only with repulsive and piteous spectacles.
Afterwards, when Thespesius found friends and relations and
intimates, whom he could never have conceived of as punished,
enduring sore sufferings and penalties both ignominious and <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
painful, and pitying themselves to him and weeping aloud;
and at last saw his own father emerging from a certain pit,
all over brands and scars, reaching out his hand towards his
son and not permitted to be silent, but compelled by the
warders to confess his infamous conduct to some strangers
who had come with gold—how he had poisoned them, and had
escaped detection there on earth, but had been convicted
here, how he had already suffered part, and was now led to
suffer the remainder—, then he did not dare to supplicate <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>567<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
or to entreat for his father, so great was his consternation and
horror. Wishing to turn about and flee, he saw no longer
that gracious and familiar guide, but was thrust forward by
others of terrible visage, because it was necessary that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>should go through it all. There he beheld the shadows of those
who had been notoriously wicked, and who had been punished
on the spot, not savagely handled as were the former ones,
because<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c006'><sup>[249]</sup></a> their trouble was in the irrational seat of the passions.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But those who had passed through life under a veil or cloak
of the appearance of virtue, were compelled by others, who stood
around, laboriously and painfully to turn their soul inside out,
writhing and bending themselves back unnaturally, as the
scolopendrae<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c006'><sup>[250]</sup></a> of the sea, when they have gorged the hook,
turn themselves inside out. Others they would flay, and fold
the skin back, to show how scarred and mottled they were
beneath it, because the vice was seated in the rational and
directing part. Other souls he said that he saw intertwined
like vipers, by twos or threes or more together, gnawing one
another out of spite and rancour for what they had suffered
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> in life, or done. And there were lakes lying side by side, one
of boiling gold, one of lead, exceeding cold, and one of iron,
which was rough. Over these stood daemons, as it might
be smiths, with tongs, picking up by turns the souls of those
whose wickedness came of greed and grasping, and plunging
them in. When they had become all fiery and transparent
in the burning gold, they were thrust into the bath of lead;
and when frozen till they became hard as hailstones, they were
shifted on to the iron, and there they became hideously black,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> and were broken up and crushed, so hard and brittle were they,
and their shapes were changed. Then they were conveyed,
just as they were, back to the gold, enduring dire pains in the
transition. Most pitiful of all, he said, was the case of those
who seemed already quit of Justice and then were seized up
anew. These were the souls whose penalty had come round
to any descendants or children. For whenever any one of these
last came up and met them, he would fall upon them in anger,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>and shout aloud, and show the marks of his sufferings, reviling
and pursuing, while the parent soul sought to flee and hide <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
itself, but could not; for the torturers would run swiftly after
and bring them to Justice, and force them through all from the
beginning, while they bewailed themselves because they knew
the punishment before them. And there were some, he said,
to whom a number of their offspring were attached, clinging
to them just like bees or bats, and jibbering in wrathful
recollection of what they had suffered on account of their
parents. Last of all, while he was looking at the souls returning
to a second birth—how they were violently bent and transformed
into animals of every sort by the executioners of this task, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
who used certain implements and blows, here squeezing together
the limbs entire, here twisting them aside, here planing them
away and getting rid of them altogether, to fit into other
characters and other lives—, there appeared among these the soul
of Nero, already in torment, and pierced with red-hot nails.
For it the executioners had prepared the form of a viper, as
Pindar describes it, wherein the beast is to be conceived, and
live, after having devoured its own mother. And then, he said,
there shone out a great light, and from the light came a voice
commanding them to shift Nero to some other milder species,
and to fashion a beast to sing around marshes and pools, for that
he had paid the penalty of his crimes; and moreover some
benefit was due to him from the Gods, because he had freed <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>568<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the best and most God-loving race, that of Hellas. Up to this
point, Thespesius had been, he said, a spectator. But as he was
about to return, he suffered a horrible fear. For a woman of
marvellous form and stature seized hold of him: “Come here,
fellow!” she said, “that thou mayest have a better memory of
these things.” Then she brought near him a rod, such as painters
use, red-hot, but another woman prevented her. He, sucked
up by a sudden violent wind, as out of a blow-pipe, fell on to his
own body, and just opened his eyes on the edge of the tomb.’</p>

<p class='c004'>[Preserved by Stobaeus, <i>Florileg.</i> 119.<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c006'><sup>[251]</sup></a>]</p>
<p class='c004'>I. When Timon had spoken thus, Patrocleas replied:
‘Your argument is as forcible as it is ancient, yet there are
difficulties. For if the doctrine of immortality is so very old,
how is it that the fear of death is “oldest of terrors”<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c006'><sup>[252]</sup></a>? Unless,
of course, it is this which has engendered all other terrors.
For there is nothing “fresh or new” in our mourning for the
dead, or in the use of those sad sinister forms of speech, “Poor
man!” “Unfortunate man!”’</p>

<p class='c005'>II. ‘But there’, said Timon, ‘we shall find a confusion
of ideas between what perishes and what does not. Now when
we speak of the dead as having “passed away” and being
“gone”, there is clearly no suggestion of anything actually harsh,
only of a change or transition of some sort. Where that change
takes place for those who undergo it, and whether it be for worse
or better, let us consider by looking into the other words used.
Our actual word for death<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c006'><sup>[253]</sup></a>, in the first place, does not appear
to point to a movement downward, or beneath the earth,
but rather to a mounting upward towards God of that which
passes. Thus we may reasonably suppose that the soul darts out
and runs upward, as though a bent spring had been released,
when the body breathes it out, and itself draws an upward
vital breath. Next, look at the opposite of death, which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>generation; this word, on the contrary, expresses a tendency
downward, an inclination to earth<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c006'><sup>[254]</sup></a> of that which at the time
of death again speeds upward. Hence, too, we call our natal
day by a name which means a beginning of evils and of great
troubles.<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c006'><sup>[255]</sup></a> Perhaps we shall see the same thing even more clearly
from another set of words. A man when he dies is said to be
“released”, and death called a “release”—if you ask the
question “from what?”, a release from body<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c006'><sup>[256]</sup></a>—for body is
called dĕmas, because the soul is kept in bondage in it, contrary
to nature, nothing being forcibly detained in a place which is
natural to it. A further play upon this “bondage” and “force”
gives the word “life”, as Homer,<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c006'><sup>[257]</sup></a> I think, uses Hesperus for
the feminine “evening”, and so, in contrast to “life”, the
dead is said to come to his rest, released from a great and
unnatural stress. So with the change and reconstitution of
the soul into the Whole; we say that it has perished when
it has made its way thither; while here it does not know this
unless at the actual approach of death, when it undergoes
such an experience as those do who are initiated into great
mysteries. Thus death and initiation closely correspond, word
to word,<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c006'><sup>[258]</sup></a> and thing to thing. At first there are wanderings,
and laborious circuits, and journeyings through the dark, full
of misgivings where there is no consummation; then, before
the very end, come terrors of every kind, shivers, and trembling,
and sweat, and amazement. After this, a wonderful light
meets the wanderer; he is admitted into pure meadow lands,
where are voices, and dances, and the majesty of holy sounds and
sacred visions. Here the newly initiate, all rites completed,
is at large; he walks at large like the dedicated victim with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>a crown on his head, and joins in high revelry; he converses
with pure and holy men, and surveys the uninitiate unpurified
crowd here below in the dirt and darkness, trampled by its
own feet and packed together; through fear of death remaining
in its ills, because it does not believe in the blessings which are
beyond. For that the conjunction of soul with body, and its
imprisonment, are against nature, you may clearly see from this.’</p>

<p class='c005'>III. ‘From what?’ said Patrocleas. ‘From the fact
that of all our experiences sleep is the most agreeable. First,
it always extinguishes any perception of pain, because its pleasure
is mingled with so much that is familiar, secondly, it overpowers
all other appetites, even the most vehement. For even those
who are devoted to the body become disinclined for pleasure
when sleep comes on, and when they slumber reject loving
embraces. Why dwell on this? When sleep takes possession,
it excludes even the pleasure which comes from learning, and
discussion, and philosophic thought, as though a smooth deep
stream swept the soul along. All pleasure, perhaps, is by its
essence and nature a respite from pain, but of sleep this is absolutely
true. For, though nothing exciting or delightful should
approach from without, yet we feel pleasure in a sound sleep;
sleep seems to remove a condition of toil and hardness. And
that condition is no other than that which binds soul to body. In
sleep the soul is separated, and speeds upward, and is gathered
unto itself after having been strained to fit the body, and dispersed
among the senses. Yet some assert that, on the contrary,
sleep immingles soul with body. They are wrong. The body
bears its witness the other way, by its lack of sensation, its
coldness, and heaviness, and pallor proving that the soul
leaves it in death, and shifts its quarters in sleep. This
produces the pleasure; it is a release and respite for the
soul, as though it laid down a burthen which it must again
resume and shoulder. For when it dies it runs away from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>body for good; when it is asleep, it plays truant. Therefore
death is sometimes accompanied by pains, sleep always by
pleasure; in the former case the bond is snapped altogether,
in the latter it gives, and is slackened, and becomes easier,
as the senses are loosened like parting knots, and the strain
which ties soul to body is gone.’</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. ‘Then how is it’, said Patrocleas, ‘that we do not feel
discomfort or pain from being awake?’ ‘How is it’, said
Timon, ‘that when the hair is cut, the head feels lightness and
relief, yet there was no sense of oppression at all while the hair
was long? Or that men released from bonds feel pleasure,
yet there is no pain when the chains are on? Or why is
there a stir of applause when light is brought suddenly into
a banquet, yet its absence did not appear to cause pain or trouble
to the eye? There is one cause, my friend, in all these cases;
that gradual habituation made the unnatural familiar to the
sense, so that it felt absolutely no distress then, but felt pleasure
when there was release and a restoration to nature. The
strangeness is seen at once when the proper condition comes,
the presence of what pained and pressed by contrast with the
pleasure. It is exactly so with the soul: during its association
with mortal passions, and parts, and organs, that which is
unnatural and strange produces no apparent pressure because
of that long familiarity; yet when discharged from the activities
of the body, it feels ease, and relief, and pleasure. By them it
is distressed, and about these it toils, and from these it
craves leisure and rest. For all that concerns its own natural
activities—observation, reasoning, memory, speculation—it is
unwearied and insatiable. Satiety is nothing but a weariness
of pleasure, when soul feels with body. To its own pleasures
soul never cries “Enough”; but while it is involved in body,
it is in the plight of Ulysses.<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c006'><sup>[259]</sup></a> As he clung to the fig-tree, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>hugged it, not from love of the tree, but fearing Charybdis
down below, so soul clings to body and embraces it, from no
goodwill to it or gratitude, but in horror of the uncertainty of
death,</p>

  <h2 id='chap08' class='c003'>ON SUPERSTITION</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c009'>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p class='c004'>The drift of Plutarch’s remarkable Treatise on Superstition
is well given in the opening words of Bacon’s famous Essay:
‘It were better to have no opinion of God at all than such
an opinion as is unworthy of him. For the one is unbelief,
the other is contumely, and certainly superstition is the
reproach of the Deity.’ The word—the same which, in its
adjective, St. Paul applies, almost in a good sense, to the
Athenians of his day<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c006'><sup>[262]</sup></a>—is correctly defined by Theophrastus,
in his ‘character’ of the superstitious man, as timidity with
regard to the supernatural, and this timidity at once passes
into cowardice. There is in this treatise a fighting spirit and
a directness of attack unusual in Plutarch, who mostly speaks
with academic balance about conflicting schools of thought.
Thus it has been suggested that one or other of his writings
against the Epicureans may be intended to supply the required
study ‘On Atheism’. There are many passages in the <i>Lives</i>
and also in the <i>Moralia</i> where the author is seen to mediate
between credulity and scepticism, superstition and atheism;
usually showing a tendency to ‘the more benign extreme’;
there is more to be lost by an undue hardening of the intellect
than by a wise hospitality to beliefs and ideas which lie beyond
strict proof. Here the attack is one-sided and uncompromising.
At the end of the treatise true piety is exhibited as a middle
path between superstition and atheism. This is not to be
understood of a quantitative excess or defect. Piety in excess
may induce a habit which deserves the name of superstition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>such as has been the fair butt of satirists in all ages, and of
humorists like Theophrastus. But Plutarch is thinking not
of excess, but of perversion, a piety directed to wrong powers,
or to powers conceived of in the wrong way. There is a striking
instance in the <i>Life of Pelopidas</i> (c. 21), when some of the prophets
invited that great soldier to obey the warning of a dream by
slaying his daughter, for which there were ancient precedents.
‘But some on the other side urged, that such a barbarous and
impious oblation could not be pleasing to any superior beings;
that Typhons and Giants did not preside over the world, but the
general father of Gods and men; that it was absurd to imagine
any Divinities or powers delighted in slaughter or sacrifices of
men; or, if there were any such, they were to be neglected,
as weak and unable to assist; such unreasonable and cruel desires
could only proceed from, and live in, weak and depraved minds.’</p>

<p class='c005'>The situation is saved by the good sense of the augur
Theocritus, the same who plays a quaint and gallant part in
the enterprise described in <i>The Genius of Socrates</i>; and a chestnut
colt takes the place of the daughter. And there is no
doubt on which side of the argument Plutarch’s sympathies lie.</p>

<p class='c005'>An admirable running commentary on Plutarch’s treatise is
supplied by the <i>Discourse on Superstition</i> of John Smith, the
Cambridge Platonist (1618-52), here printed as an Appendix
to it. Like Bacon, John Smith has written also a <i>Discourse on
Atheism</i>, from which it may be sufficient for the present
purpose to quote the words of the Son of Sirach appended as
his conclusion:</p>

<p class='c005'>‘O Lord, Father and God of my life, give me not a proud
look, but turn away from thy servants a Giant-like minde’
(Ecclus. 23, 4).</p>

<p class='c005'>See, for this whole treatise, Dr. Oakesmith’s Chapter IX,
pp. 179 foll.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>
  <h3 class='c016'>ON SUPERSTITION</h3>
</div>
<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>164 <span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The stream of ignorance and of misconception about the
Gods passed, from the very first, into two channels; one branch
flowed, as it were, over stony places, and has produced atheism
in hard characters, the other over moist ground, and this has
produced superstition in the tender ones. Now any error of
judgement, especially on such matters, is a vicious thing, but
if passion be added it is more vicious. For all passion is ‘deceit
accompanied by inflammation’; and as dislocations are more <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
serious when there is also a wound, so are distortions of the soul
when there is passion. A man thinks that atoms and a void
are the first principles of the universe; the conception is
a false one, but does not produce ulceration or spasm, or
tormenting pain. Another conceives of wealth as the greatest <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>165<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
good; this falsity has poison in it, preys on his soul, deranges it,
allows him no sleep, fills him with stinging torments, thrusts
him down steep places, strangles him, takes away all confidence
of speech. Again, some think that virtue is a corporeal thing,
and vice also; this is a gross piece of ignorance perhaps, but
not worthy of lament or groans. But where there are such
judgements and conceptions as these:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Alas, poor Virtue! so thou art but words,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>And as a thing I was pursuing thee</i><a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c006'><sup>[263]</sup></a>—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>dropping, he means, the injustice which makes money, and the
intemperance which is parent of all pleasure—, these it is
worth our while to pity and to resent also, because their presence <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
in the soul breeds diseases and passions in numbers, very worms
and vermin.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>II. And so it is with the subjects of our present discourse.
Atheism, which is a faulty judgement that there is nothing
blessed or imperishable, seems to work round through disbelief
in the Divine to actual apathy; its object in not acknowledging
Gods is that it may not fear them. Superstition is
shown by its very name to be a state of opinion charged with
emotion and productive of such fear as debases and crushes
the man; he thinks that there are Gods, but that they are
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> grievous and hurtful. The atheist appears to be unmoved at
the mention of the Divine; the superstitious is moved, but
in a wrong and perverted sense. Ignorance has produced in
the one disbelief of the power which is helping him, in the
other a superadded idea that it is hurting. Hence atheism
is theory gone wrong, superstition is ingrained feeling, the
outcome of false theory.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. Now all diseases and affections of the soul are discreditable,
but there is in some of them a gaiety, a loftiness,
a distinction, which come of a light heart; we may say that
none of these is wanting in a strong active impulse. Only
there is this common charge to be laid against every such
affection, that by stress of the active impulse it forces and
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> constrains the reason. Fear alone, as deficient in daring as
it is in reason, keeps the irrational part inoperative, without
resource or shift. Hence it has been called by two names,
‘Deima’ and ‘Tarbos’,<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c006'><sup>[264]</sup></a> because it at once constricts and vexes
the soul. But of all fears that which comes of superstition
is most inoperative, and most resourceless. The man who
never sails fears not the sea, nor the non-combatant, war; the
home-keeping man fears no robbers, the poor no informers,
the plain citizen no envy, the dweller among the Gauls<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c006'><sup>[265]</sup></a> no
earthquake, among the Ethiopians no thunder. The man who
fears the Gods fears everything, land, sea; air, sky; darkness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>light; sound, silence; to dream, to wake. Slaves forget <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
their masters while they sleep, sleep eases the prisoner’s chain;
angry wounds, ulcers that raven and prey upon the flesh, and
agonizing pains, all stand aloof from men that sleep:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Dear soothing sleep, that com’st to succour pains,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>How sweet is thy approach in this my need.</i><a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c006'><sup>[266]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Superstition does not allow a man to say this; she alone has no
truce with sleep, and suffers not the soul to breathe awhile, and <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
take courage, and thrust away its bitter heavy thoughts about
the God. The sleep of the superstitious is a land of the ungodly,
where blood-curdling visions, and monstrous whirling phantoms,
and sure penalties are awake; the unhappy soul is hunted by
dreams out of every spell of sleep it has, lashed and punished
by itself, as though by some other, and receives injunctions
horrible and revolting. Then when they have risen out of
sleep, they do not scorn it all, or laugh it down, or perceive
that none of the things which vexed them was real, but, escaped
from the shadow of an illusion with no harm in it, they fall upon
a vision of the day and deceive themselves outright, and spend <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>166<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
money to vex their souls, meeting with quacks and charlatans
who tell them:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>If nightly vision fright thy sleep,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Or hags their hellish revel keep</i>,<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c006'><sup>[267]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>call in the wise woman, and take a dip into the sea, then sit
on the ground, and remain so a whole day.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Ah! Greeks, what ills outlandish have ye found</i>,<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c006'><sup>[268]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>namely, by superstition—dabbling in mud, plunges into
filth, keepings of Sabbaths, falling on the face, foul attitudes,
weird prostrations. Those who were concerned to keep music
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>regular used to enjoin on singers to the harp to sing ‘with
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> mouth aright’. But we require that men should pray to the
gods with mouth aright and just; not to consider whether
the tongue of the victim be clean and correct, while they
distort their own and foul it with absurd outlandish words and
phrases, and transgress against the divine rule of piety as our
fathers knew it. The man in the comedy has a passage which
puts it happily to those who plate their bedsteads with gold
and silver:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>The one free gift of gods to mortals, sleep,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Why make it for thyself a costly boon?</i><a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c006'><sup>[269]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> So we may say to the superstitious man, that the Gods gave
sleep for oblivion of troubles and a respite from them; why
make it for thyself a cell of punishment, a chamber of abiding
torment, whence the miserable soul cannot run away unto any
other sleep? Heraclitus<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c006'><sup>[270]</sup></a> says that ‘waking men have one
world common to all, but in sleep each betakes him to a world
of his own.’ The superstitious has no world, no, not a common
world, since neither while he is awake does he enjoy his
reason, nor when he sleeps is he set free from his tormentor;
reason ever drowses, and fear is ever awake; there is no escape,
nor change of place.</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. Polycrates was a terrible tyrant in Samos, Periander
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> at Corinth, yet no one continued to fear them when he had
removed to a free and democratic state. But when a man
fears the sovereignty of the Gods as a grim inexorable tyranny,
whither shall he migrate, where find exile, what sort of land
can he find where no Gods are, or of sea? Into what portion
of the world wilt thou creep and hide thyself, and believe,
thou miserable creature, that thou hast escaped from God?
There is a law which allows even slaves, if they have despaired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>of liberty, to petition to be sold, and so change to a milder
master. Superstition allows no exchange of Gods, nor is it
possible to find a God who shall not be terrible to him who
fears those of his country and his clan, who shivers at the ‘Preservers’
and trembles in alarm before the beneficent beings
from whom we ask wealth, plenty, peace, concord, a successful <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
issue for our best of words and works. And then these men
reckon slavery a misfortune, and say:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>A dire mishap it is, for man or maid,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>To pass to service of some ill-starred lord.</i><a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c006'><sup>[271]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Yet how much more dire is it, think you, for them to pass to
lords from whom is no flight, or running away, no shifting.
The slave has an altar to flee unto, even for robbers many
temples are inviolable, and fugitives in war, if they lay hold
of shrine or temple, take courage. The superstitious shudders in
alarm at those very things beyond all others, wherein those who
fear the worst find hope. Never drag the superstitious man
from temples; within them is punishment and retribution <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
for him. Why more words? ‘Death is the limit of life to
all mankind.’<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c006'><sup>[272]</sup></a> Yes, but even death is no limit to superstition;
superstition crosses the boundaries to the other side, and makes
fear endure longer than life. It attaches to death the apprehension
of undying ills, and when it ceases from troubles, it <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>167<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
thinks to enter upon troubles which never cease. Gates are
opened for it into a very depth of Hades, rivers of fire and streams
which flow out of Styx mingle their floods; darkness itself
is spread with phantoms manifold, obtruding cruel visions and
pitiful voices; there are judges and tormentors, and chasms and
abysses which teem with myriad evil things. Thus has superstition,
that God-banned fear of Gods, made that inevitable to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>itself by anticipation, of which it had escaped the suffering
in act.<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c006'><sup>[273]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>V. None of these horrors attaches to atheism. Yet its
ignorance is distressing; it is a great misfortune to a soul
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> to see so wrong and grope so blindly about such great matters,
because the light is extinguished of the brightest and most
availing out of many eyes when the perception of God is lost.
But to the opinion now before us there does attach from the
very first, as we have already said, an emotional element, cankering,
perturbing, and slavish. Plato<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c006'><sup>[274]</sup></a> says that music, whose
work it is to make men’s lives harmonious and rhythmical,
was given to them by Gods, not for wanton tickling of the ears,
but to clear the revolutions and harmonies of the soul
from the disturbing impulses which rove within the body,

<p class='c011'>Yes, they grow savage and rebellious, as the tigers, they say,
are maddened and troubled at the sound of the drum, and at
last tear themselves to pieces. A lesser evil then it is for those
who, through deafness and a dulled ear, are apathetic and
insensible to music. Tiresias was unfortunate that he could
not see his children and familiar friends, but far worse was the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> case of Athamas and of Agave, who saw them as lions and stags.
Better, I think, it was for Hercules in his madness not to see
his sons, or feel their presence, than to treat his dearest ones
as enemies.</p>

<p class='c005'>VI. What then? Comparing the feeling of the atheists with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>that of the superstitious, do we not find a similar difference?
The former see no Gods at all, the latter think that they exist as
evil beings. The former neglect them, the latter imagine that
to be terrible which is kind, that tyrannical which is fatherly,
loving care to be injury, the ‘unapproachable’<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c006'><sup>[276]</sup></a> to be savage and
brutal. Then, trusting to coppersmiths, or marble workers, or
modellers in wax, they fashion the forms of the Gods in human
shape, and these they mould and frame and worship; while <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
they despise philosophers and men who know life, if they point
them to the majesty of God consisting with goodness, and magnanimity,
and patience, and solicitude. Thus in the former the
result is insensibility and want of belief in all that is fair and
helpful, in the latter confusion and fear in the presence of help.
In a word, atheism is an apathy for the Divine which fails to
perceive the good, superstition is an excess of feeling which
suspects that the good is evil. They fear the Gods, and they
flee to the Gods for refuge; they flatter and they revile them;
they invoke and they censure them. It is man’s common lot
not to succeed always or in all. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c011'>as Pindar<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c006'><sup>[277]</sup></a> says; but human sufferings and doings flow in
a mingled stream of vicissitude, now this way, now that.</p>

<p class='c005'>VII. Now look with me at the atheist, first when things cross
his wishes, and consider his attitude. If he is a decent, quiet
person, he takes what comes in silence, and provides his own
means of succour and consolation. If he be impatient and
querulous, he directs all his complainings against Fortune, and <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>168<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the way things happen; he cries out that nothing goes by
justice or as Providence ordains, all is confused and jumbled up;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>the tangled web of human life is unpicked. Not so the superstitious:
if the ill which has befallen him be the veriest trifle,
still he sits down and builds on to his annoyance a pile of troubles,
grievous and great and inextricable, heaping up for himself fears,
dreads, suspicions, worries, a victim to every sort of groaning
and lamentation; for he blames not man, nor fortune, nor
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> occasion, nor himself, but for all the God. From that quarter
comes pouring upon him, he says, a Heaven-sent stream of woe;
he is punished thus by the Gods not because he is unfortunate,
but because he is specially hated by them, all that he suffers is
his own proper deserts. Then the atheist, when he is sick,
reckons up his own surfeitings, carouses, irregularities in diet,
or over-fatigues, or unaccustomed changes of climate or place.
Or, again, if he have met with political reverses, become unpopular
or discredited in high quarters, he seeks for the cause in
himself or his party.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>But to the superstitious every infirmity of his body, every
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> loss of money, any death of a child, foul weather and failures
in politics, are reckoned for blows from the God and assaults
of the fiend. Hence he does not even take courage to help
himself, to get rid of the trouble, or to remedy it, or make
resistance, lest he should seem to be fighting the Gods, and
resisting when punished. So the doctor is thrust out of the
sick man’s chamber, and the mourner’s door is closed against the
sage who comes to comfort and advise. ‘Man,’ he says, ‘let
me take my punishment, as the miscreant that I am, an accursed
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> object of hate to Gods and daemons.’ It is open to a man who
has no conviction that there are Gods, when suffering from some
great grief and trouble, to wipe away a tear, to cut his hair, to
put off his mourning. How are you going to address the superstitious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>in like case, wherein to bring him help? He sits outside,
clothed in sackcloth, or with filthy rags hanging about him, as
often as not rolling naked in the mud, while he recites errors
and misdoings of his own, how he ate this, or drank that, or
walked on a road which the spirit did not allow. At the very
best, if he have taken superstition in a mild form, he sits in
the house fumigating and purifying himself. The old women
‘make a peg of him’, as Bion says, and on it they hang—whatever <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
they choose to bring!</p>

<p class='c005'>VIII. They say that Tiribazus, when arrested by the
Persians, drew his scimitar, being a powerful man, and fought
for his life; then, when they loudly protested that the arrest
was by the king’s orders, at once dropped his point, and held
out his hands to be tied. Is not this just what happens in the
case before us? Other men make a fight against mischances and
thrust all aside, that they may devise ways of escape and evade
what is unwelcome to themselves. But the superstitious man
listens to nobody, and addresses himself thus: ‘Poor wretch, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
thy sufferings come from Providence, and by the order of the
God.’ So he flings away all hope, gives himself up, flies,
obstructs those who try to help him. Many tolerable troubles
are made deadly by various superstitions. Midas<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c006'><sup>[279]</sup></a> of old,
as we are to believe, dispirited and distressed by certain dreams,
was so miserable that he sought a voluntary death by drinking
bulls’ blood. Aristodemus, king of the Messenians, during the
war with the Lacedaemonians, when dogs were howling like
wolves, and rye grass sprouting around his ancestral hearth, in
utter despair at the extinction of all his hopes, cut his own throat.
Perhaps it would have been better for Nicias<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c006'><sup>[280]</sup></a>, the Athenian <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>169<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
general, to find the same release from superstition as Midas or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>Aristodemus, and not, in his terror of the shadow when the
moon was eclipsed, to sit still under blockade, and afterwards,
when forty thousand had been slaughtered or taken alive, to be
taken prisoner and die ingloriously. For there is nothing so
terrible when the earth blocks the way, or when its shadow
meets the moon in due cycle of revolutions; what is terrible is
that a man should plunge<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c006'><sup>[281]</sup></a> into the darkness of superstition,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> and that its dark shadow should confound a man’s reason and

what we call critical occasions, but it has no advantage, even in
what is more pleasant, over atheism. Nothing is more pleasant
to men than feasts, temple banquets, initiations, orgies, prayers
to the Gods, and solemn supplications. See the atheist there,
laughing in a wild sardonic peal at the proceedings, probably
with a quiet aside to his intimates, that those who think
this all done for the Gods are crazed and possessed; but that
is the worst that can be said of him. The superstitious man
wants to be cheerful and enjoy himself, but he cannot.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> So is the soul of the superstitious. With the crown on his head
he grows pale; while he sacrifices he shudders; he prays with
a quivering voice and offers incense with hands that shake; he
shows all through that Pythagoras<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c006'><sup>[289]</sup></a> talks nonsense when he says:
‘We reach our best when we draw near to the Gods.’ For it is
then that the superstitious are at their miserable worst; the
halls and temples of the Gods which they approach are for them
dens of bears, lairs of serpents, caverns of monsters of the sea!</p>

<p class='c005'>X. Hence it comes upon me as a surprise when men say that <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
atheism is impiety, but that superstition is not. Yet Anaxagoras
had to answer a charge of impiety for saying that the sun
is a stone, whereas no one has called the Cimmerians impious
for thinking that there is no sun at all. What do you say? Is
the man who recognizes no Gods a profane person, and does
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>not he, who takes them for such beings as the superstitious
think, hold a far more profane creed? I know that I would
rather men said about me that there is not, and never has come
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>170<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> into existence, a Plutarch, than that there is a man Plutarch
unstable, shifty, readily provoked, revengeful over accidents,
aggrieved at trifles; who, if you leave him out of your supper
party, if you are busy and do not come to the door, if you pass
him without a greeting, will cling to your flesh like a leech and
gnaw it, or will catch your child, and thrash him to pieces, or will
turn some beast, if he keep one, into your crops, and ruin the
harvest. When Timotheus was singing of Artemis at Athens
in the words:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Wanderer, frenzied one, wild and inebriate!</i></div>

</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Cinesias the composer rose from his place with ‘Such a daughter
be thine!’ Yet the like of this, and worse things too, do the
superstitious hold about Artemis:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>She would burn a hanging woman,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>She a mother in her pangs;</i></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Nor will their views about Apollo, or Hera, or Aphrodite be a
whit more decent, they fear and tremble at them all. Yet what
was there in Niobe’s blasphemy about Latona, compared to what
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> superstition has persuaded fools to believe about that goddess, how
she felt herself insulted and actually shot down the poor woman’s</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>so greedy of calamities for another woman, so implacable! For
if the Goddess had really been full of wrath and resentment of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>wickedness, and felt aggrieved at insults to herself, disposed to
resent, rather than to smile at human folly and ignorance, why
then she ought to have shot down those who lyingly imputed
to her such savage bitterness, in speech or books. Certainly we
denounce the bitterness of Hecuba as savage and beastly: <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c011'>But of the Syrian Goddess superstitious men believe that if one

<p class='c005'>XI. How then? Is it impious to say bad things about the
Gods, but not impious to think them? Or is it the thought of the
blasphemer which makes his voice amiss? We men scout abusive
language as the outward sign of ill-feeling. We reckon for
enemies those who speak ill of us because we think that they
also think ill. Now you see the sort of things which the superstitious
think about the Gods; they take them to be capricious, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
faithless, shifty, revengeful, cruel, vexed about trifles, all reasons
why the superstitious must perforce hate and fear the Gods.
Of course he does, when he thinks that they have been, and will
be again, authors of his greatest ills. But if he hates and fears
the Gods, he is their enemy. Yet he worships, and sacrifices,
and sits before their shrines. And no wonder; men salute tyrants
also, and court them, and set up their figures in gold. But ‘in
silence’ they hate them, ‘wagging the head’.<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c006'><sup>[294]</sup></a> Hermolaus
remained Alexander’s courtier, Pausanias served on Philip’s <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>The atheist thinks there are no Gods, the superstitious wishes
that there were none; he believes against his will, for he
fears to disbelieve. And yet, as Tantalus would gladly slip
from beneath the stone swinging over his head, so is it with the
superstitious and his fear, a pressure no less sore. He would
reckon the atheist’s mood a blessed one, for there is freedom
in it. As things are, the atheist is quite clear of superstition;
the superstitious is at heart an atheist, only too weak to believe
what he wishes to believe about the Gods.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>171<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> XII. Again, the atheist is in no sense responsible for
superstition, whereas superstition provides atheism with a
principle which brings it into being, and then an apology for
its existence which is neither true nor honest, but is in a sense
colourable. For it is not because they find anything to blame in
sky, or stars, or seasons, or cycles of the moon, or movements of
the sun around the earth, ‘those artificers of day and night’,<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c006'><sup>[296]</sup></a> or
espy confusion and disorder in the breeding of animals or the
increase of fruits, that they condemn the universe to godlessness.
No! Superstition and its ridiculous doings and emotions, words,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> gestures, juggleries, sorceries, coursings around and beatings of
cymbals, purifications which are impure, and cleansings which
are filthy, weird illegal punishments and degradations at
temples—these give certain persons a pretext for saying that
better no Gods than Gods, if Gods accept such things and take
pleasure in them, Gods so violent, so petty, so sore about trifles.</p>

<p class='c005'>XIII. Were it not better then for those Gauls<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c006'><sup>[297]</sup></a> and Scythians
to have had no notion at all about Gods, neither imagination nor
record of them, than to think that there are Gods who take
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> pleasure in the blood of slaughtered men and who accept that
as the supreme form of solemn sacrifice? What? Were it not
an advantage to the Carthaginians to have had a Critias or
a Diagoras for their first lawgiver and to recognize neither God
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>nor daemon, than to offer such sacrifices as they did offer to
Cronus?<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c006'><sup>[298]</sup></a> It was not the case which Empedocles puts against
those who sacrifice animals:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Father, uplifting his son, not marking the change of the body,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Prays as he takes the dear life, poor fool.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Knowing and recognizing their own children, they used to
sacrifice them—nay, the childless would buy children from
poor parents and cut their throats as though they were lambs or
chickens—, and the mother would stand by dry-eyed and with <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
never a groan. If she should groan or weep, she would have to
lose the merit, and the child was sacrificed all the same, while the
whole space in front of the shrine was filled with the rattle of
drums and the din of fifes, in order that the sound of the wailing
might be drowned. Suppose that Typhons, say, or Giants,
had turned out the Gods and were our rulers, in what sacrifices
but these would they delight, or what other solemnities would
they require? Amestris,<a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c006'><sup>[299]</sup></a> wife of Xerxes, buried twelve men
alive, as her own offering to Hades, who, as Plato<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c006'><sup>[300]</sup></a> tells us, is <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
kind and wise and detains souls by persuasion and reason, and
so has been named ‘Hades’. Xenophanes,<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c006'><sup>[301]</sup></a> the natural philosopher,
when he saw the Egyptians beating their breasts and
wailing at their feasts, gave them a home lesson: ‘If these are
Gods, do not mourn them; if men, why sacrifice to them?</p>

<p class='c005'>XIV. There is no sort of disease so capricious and so varied
in emotions, such a medley of opposite, or rather conflicting,
opinions, as is that of superstition. We must flee from it then,
but as safety and advantage point, not like men who run for
their lives from robbers or beasts or fire, never looking round or
using their heads, and plunge into pathless wastes with pits and <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
precipices. For that is how some flee from superstition and
plunge into a rough and flinty atheism, overleaping Piety
seated in the middle space.</p>

  <h3 class='c009'>Of Superstition</h3>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Having now done with what we propounded as a <i>Preface</i> to
our following <i>Discourses</i>, we should now come to treat of the
<i>main Heads and Principles of Religion</i>. But before we doe that,
perhaps it may not be amiss to enquire into some of those <i>Anti-Deities</i>
that are set up against it, the chief whereof are <span class='sc'>Atheism</span>
and <span class='sc'>Superstition</span>; which indeed may seeme to comprehend in
them all kind of Apostasy and Praevarication from Religion.
We shall not be over-curious to pry into such foule and rotten
carkasses as these are too narrowly, or to make any subtile anatomy
of them; but rather enquire a litle into the Original and
Immediate Causes of them; because it may be they may be
nearer of kin then we ordinarily are aware of, while we see
their Complexions to be so vastly different the one from the
other.</p>

<p class='c005'>And first of all for <span class='sc'>Superstition</span> (to lay aside our Vulgar notion
of it which much mistakes it) it is the same with that Temper
of Mind which the Greeks call Δεισιδαιμονία, (for so Tully frequently
translates that word, though not so fitly and emphatically
as he hath done some others:) It imports <i>an overtimorous and
dreadfull apprehension of the Deity</i>; and therefore with <i>Hesychius</i>
Δεισιδαιμονία and Φοβοθεΐα are all one, and Δεισιδαίμων is
by him expounded ὁ εἰδωλολάτρης, ὁ εὐσεβής, καὶ δειλὸς παρὰ
θεοῖς, <i>an Idolater, and also one that is very prompt to worship the
Gods, but withall fearfull of them</i>. And therefore <i>the true Cause
and Rise of Superstition</i> is indeed nothing else but <i>a false opinion</i>
of the Deity, that renders him dreadfull and terrible, as being
rigorous and imperious; that which represents him as austere
and apt to be angry, but yet impotent, and easy to be appeased
again by some <i>flattering devotions</i>, especially if performed with
sanctimonious shewes and a solemn sadness of Mind. And
I wish that that Picture of God which some Christians have
drawn of him, wherein Sowreness and Arbitrariness appear so
much, doth not too much resemble it. According to this sense,
Plutarch hath well defined it in his book περὶ δεισιδαιμονίας
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>in this manner, δόξαν ἐμπαθῆ καὶ δέους ποιητικὴν ὑπόληψιν
οὖσαν ἐκταπεινοῦντος καὶ συντρίβοντος τὸν ἄνθρωπον, οἰόμενον
τε εἶναι θεοὺς εἶναι δὲ λυπηροὺς καὶ βλαβερούς, <i>a strong
passionate Opinion, and such a Supposition as is productive of a
fear debasing and terrifying a man with the representation of
the Gods as grievous and hurtfull to Mankind</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Such men as these converse not with the <i>Goodness</i> of God,
and therefore they are apt to attribute their impotent passions
and peevishness of Spirit to him. Or it may be because some
secret advertisements of their Consciences tell them how <i>unlike</i>
they themselves are <i>to God</i>, and how they have provoked him;
they are apt to be as much displeased with him as too troublesome
to them, as they think he is displeased with them. They
are apt to count this Divine Supremacy as but a piece of tyranny
that by its Soveraign Will makes too great encroachments upon
their Liberties, and that which will eat up all their Right and
Property; and therefore are lavishly afraid of him, τὴν τῶν
θεῶν ἀρχὴν ὡς τυραννίδα φοβούμενοι σκυθρωπὴν καὶ ἀπαραίτητον,
<i>fearing Heaven’s Monarchy as a severe and churlish Tyranny from
which they cannot absolve themselves</i>, as the same Author speaks:
and therefore he thus discloseth the private whisperings of their
minds, ᾅδου τινες ἀνοίγονται πύλαι βαθείαι, καὶ ποταμοῖ πυρὸς
ὁμοῦ καὶ στυγὸς ἀπορρῶγες ἀναπετάννυνται, &amp;c., <i>the broad gates
of hell are opened, the rivers of fire and Stygian inundations
run down as a swelling flood, there is thick darkness crowded
together, dreadfull and gastly Sights of Ghosts screeching and
howling, Judges and tormentors, deep gulfes and Abysses full of
infinite miseries</i>. Thus he. The Prophet <i>Esay</i> gives us this
Epitome of their thoughts, chap. 33: <i>The Sinners in Zion</i> are
afraid, fearfulness hath surprized the hypocrites: who shall
dwell with the devouring fire? who shall dwell with everlasting
burnings? Though I should not dislike these dreadful and
astonishing thoughts of future torment, which I doubt even
good men may have cause to press home upon their own spirits,
while they find Ingenuity less active, the more to restrain sinne;
yet I think it little commends God, and as little benefits us, to
fetch all this horror and astonishment from the Contemplations
of a Deity, which should alwayes be the most serene and lovely:
our apprehensions of the Deity should be such as might <i>ennoble</i>
our Spirits, and not <i>debase</i> them. A right knowledge of God
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>would beget a <i>freedome</i> and <i>Liberty</i> of Soul within us, and not
<i>servility</i>; ἀρετῆς γὰρ ἐλπὶς ὁ Θεός εστιν οὐ δουλείας πρόφασις,
as Plutarch hath well observ’d; our thoughts of a Deity should
breed in us hopes of Vertue, and not gender to a spirit of
bondage.</p>

<p class='c005'>But that we may pass on. Because this unnaturall resemblance
of God as an angry Deity in impure minds, should it
blaze too furiously, like the Basilisk would kill with its looks;
therefore these Painters use their best arts a little to sweeten it,
and render it less unpleasing. And those that fancy God to be
most hasty and apt to be displeased, yet are ready also to imagine
him so impotently mutable, that his favour may be won again
with their uncouth devotions, that he will be taken with their
formall praises, and being thirsty after glory and praise and
solemn addresses, may, by their pompous furnishing out all
these for him, be won to a good liking of them: and thus they
represent him to themselves as Lucian, in his <i>De Sacrificiis</i> [c. I]
speaks too truly, though it may be too profanely, ὡς κολακευόμενον
ἥδεσθαι, καὶ ἀγανακτεῖν ἀμελούμενον. And therefore
<i>Superstition</i> will alwaies abound in these things whereby this
Deity of their own, made after the similitude of men, may be
most gratified, slavishly crouching to it. We will take a view of
it in the words of <i>Plutarch</i>, though what refers to the <span class='sc'>Jews</span>, if
it respects more their rites than their Manners, may seem to
contain too hasty a censure of them. <i>Superstition</i> brings in
πηλώσεις, καταβορβορώσεις, σαββατισμούς, ῥίψεις ἐπὶ πρόσωπον,
αἰσχρὰς προκαθίσεις, ἀλλοκότους προσκυνήσεις, <i>wallowings in
the dust, tumblings in the mire, observations of Sabbaths, prosternations,
uncouth gestures, and strange rites of worship</i>. Superstition
is very apt to think that Heaven may be bribed with
such false-hearted devotions; as Porphyrie, <i>Lib.</i> 2, περὶ ἀποχῆς,
hath well explained it by this, that it is ὑπόληψις τοῦ δεκάζειν
δύνασθαι τὸ θεῖον, <i>an apprehension that a man may corrupt and
bribe the Deity</i>; which (as he there observes) was the Cause
of all those bloudy sacrifices and of some inhumane ones among
the Heathen men, imagining διὰ τῶν θυσιῶν ἐξωνεῖσθαι τὴν
ἁμαρτίαν like him in the Prophet that thought by the fruit of
his body and the firstlings of his flock to expiate the sinne of
his Soul. <i>Micah</i> 6.</p>

<p class='c005'>But it may be we may seeme all this while to have made too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>Tragicall a Description of <i>Superstition</i>; and indeed one Author
whom we have all this while had recourse to, seemes to have set
it forth, as anciently Painters were wont to doe those pieces in
which they would demonstrate most their own skill; they would
not content themselves with the shape of one Body onely, but
borrowed severall parts from severall Bodies as might most fit
their design and fill up the picture of that they desired chiefly
to represent. <i>Superstition</i> it may be looks not so foul and
deformed in every Soul that is dyed with it, as he hath there set
it forth, nor doth it every where spread it self alike: this πάθος
that shrowds it self under the name of <i>Religion</i>, wil <i>variously</i>
discover it self as it is seated in Minds of a <i>various</i> temper, and
meets with <i>variety of matter</i> to exercise it self about.</p>

<p class='c005'>We shall therefore a little further inquire into it, and what the
Judgments of the soberest men anciently were of it; the rather
that a learned Author of our own seems unwilling to own that
Notion of it which we have hitherto out of <i>Plutarch</i> and others
contended for; who though he have freed it from that gloss
which the late Ages have put upon it, yet he may seem to have
too strictly confined it to a Cowardly Worship of the ancient
Gentile Daemons, as if <i>Superstition and Polytheism</i> were indeed
the same thing, whereas <i>Polytheism</i> or <i>Daemon-worship</i> is but
one branch of it, which was partly observed by the learned
<i>Casaubon</i> in his Notes upon that Chapter of <i>Theophrastus</i> περὶ
δεισιδαιμονίας, when it is described to be δειλία πρὸς τὸ
δαιμόνιον, which he thus interprets, Theophrastus <i>voce</i> δαιμόνιον
<i>et Deos et Daemones complexus est, et quicquid divinitatis
esse particeps malesana putavit antiquitas</i>. And in this sense it
was truly observed by <i>Petronius Arbiter</i>,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Primus in orbe Deos fecit Timor</i>—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The whole progeny of the ancient Daemons, at least in the
Minds of the Vulgar, sprung out of <i>Fear</i>, and were supported by
it: though notwithstanding, this Fear, when in a Being void of
all true sense of Divine goodness, hath not escaped the censure
of <i>Superstition</i> in <i>Varro’s</i> judgment, whose Maxim it was, as
S. <i>Austin</i> tells us, <i>Deum a religioso vereri, a superstitioso timeri</i>:
which distinction <i>Servius</i> seems to have made use of in his
Comment upon <i>Virgil</i>, <i>Aeneid</i> 6, where the Poet describing the
torments of the wicked in hell, he runs out into an Allegoricall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>exposition of all, it may be too much in favour of <i>Lucretius</i>, whom
he there magnifies. His words are these, <i>Ipse etiam Lucretius
dicit per eos super quos jamjam casurus imminet lapis</i>, Superstitiosos
<i>significare, qui inaniter semper verentur, et de Diis et Cœlo et
locis superioribus male opinantur; nam</i> Religiosi <i>sunt qui per
reverentiam timent</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>But that we may the more fully unfold the <i>Nature</i> of this
πάθος, and the effects of it, which are not alwaies of one sort,
we shall first premise something concerning the Rise of it.</p>

<p class='c005'>The <i>Common Notions</i> of a Deity, strongly rooted in Mens
Souls, and meeting with the Apprehensions of <i>Guiltiness</i>, are
very apt to excite the <i>Servile</i> fear: and when men love their
own filthy lusts, that they may spare them, they are presently apt
to contrive some other waies of appeasing the Deity and compounding
with it. Unhallowed minds, that have no inward
foundation of true Holiness to fix themselves upon, are easily
shaken and tossed from all inward peace and tranquillity; and
as the thoughts of some Supreme power above them seize upon
them, so they are struck with the lightning thereof into inward
affrightments, which are further encreas’d by a vulgar observation
of those strange, stupendious, and terrifying Effects in
Nature, whereof they can give no certain reason, as Earthquakes,
Thundrings, and Lightnings, blazing Comets and other Meteors
of a like Nature, which are apt to terrifie those especially who
are already unsetled and Chased with an inward sense of guilt,
and, as Seneca speaks, <i>inevitabilem metum ut supra nos aliquid
timeremus incutiunt</i>. <i>Petronius Arbiter</i> hath well described this
business for us,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Primus in orbe Deos fecit Timor, ardua cœlo</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Fulmina cum caderent, discussaque moenia flammis,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Atque ictus flagraret Athos</i>—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>From hence it was that the <i>Libri fulgurales</i> of the <i>Romanes</i>, and
other such volumes of <i>Superstition</i>, swelled so much, and that the
<i>pulvinaria Deorum</i> were so often frequented, as will easily appear
to any one a little conversant in <i>Livy</i>, who everywhere sets forth
this Devotion so largely, as if he himself had been too passionately
in love with it.</p>

<p class='c005'>And though as the <i>Events</i> in Nature began sometimes to be
found out better by a discovery of their immediate Natural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>Causes, so some particular pieces of Superstitious Customs were
antiquated and grown out of date (as is well observ’d concerning
those <i>Charms</i> and <i>Februations</i> anciently in use upon the appearing
of an Eclipse, and some others) yet often affrights and
horrours were not so easily abated, while they were unacquainted
with the Deity, and with the other mysterious events in Nature,
which begot those Furies and unlucky Empusas ἀλάστορας καὶ
παλαμναίους δαίμονας, in the weak minds of men. To all which
we may adde the frequent <i>Spectres</i> and frightfull <i>Apparitions</i> of
Ghosts and <i>Mormos</i>: all which extorted such a kind of Worship
from them as was most correspondent to such Causes of it. And
those Rites and Ceremonies which were begotten by Superstition,
were again the unhappy Nurses of it, such as are well
described by <i>Plutarch</i> in his <i>De defect. Oracul.</i>, Ἑορταὶ καὶ θυσίαι,
ὥσπερ ἡμέραι ἀποφράδες, καὶ σκυθρωπαί, ἐν αἷς ὠμοφαγίας, &amp;c.
<i>Feasts and Sacrifices, as likewise observations of unlucky and fatall
dayes, celebrated with eating of raw things, lacerations, fastings,
and howlings, and many times filthy Speeches in their sacred rites</i>,
and frantick behaviour.</p>

<p class='c005'>But as we insinuated before, This Root of <i>Superstition</i> diversely
branched forth it self, sometimes into <i>Magick</i> and <i>Exorcismes</i>,
other times into Pædanticall Rites and idle observations of
<i>Things</i> and <i>Times</i>, as <i>Theophrastus</i> hath largely set them forth
in his Tract περὶ δεισιδαιμονίας: in others it displayed itself
in inventing as many <i>new Deities</i> as there were severall Causes
from whence their affrights proceeded, and finding out many
φρικτὰ μυστήρια appropriate to them, as supposing they ought
to be worshipt <i>cum sacro horrore</i>. And hence it is that we hear
of those inhumane and Diabolicall sacrifices called ἀνθρωποθυσίαι,
frequent among the old Heathens (as among many others
<i>Porphyry</i> in his <i>De abstinentia</i> hath abundantly related) and of
those dead mens bones which our Ecclesiastick writers tell us
were found in their Temples at the demolishing of them.
Sometimes it would express itself in a prodigall way of sacrificing,
for which <i>Ammianus Marcellinus</i> (an heathen Writer, but yet
one who seems to have been well pleased with the simplicity
and integrity of Christian Religion) taxeth <i>Julian</i> the Emperor
for Superstition. <i>Iulianus, Superstitiosus magis quam legitimus
sacrorum observator, innumeras sine parsimonia pecudes mactans,
ut æstimaretur, si revertisset de Parthis, boves iam defuturos</i>:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>like that Marcus Caesar, of whom he relates this common
proverb, οἱ λευκοὶ βέες Μάρκῳω τῷ Καίσαρι, ἄν συ νικήσῃς, ἡμεῖς
ἀπωλόμεθα. Besides many other ways might be named wherein
<i>Superstition</i> might occasionally shew it self.</p>

<p class='c005'>All which may best be understood, if we consider it a little
in that Composition of <i>Fear</i> and <i>Flattery</i> which before we intimated:
and indeed <i>Flattery</i> is most incident to <i>base</i> and
<i>slavish</i> minds; and when the fear and jealousy of a Deity disquiet
a wanton dalliance with sin, and disturb the filthy pleasure
of Vice, then this fawning and crouching disposition will find
out devices to quiet an angry conscience within, and an offended
God without, (though as men grow more expert in this cunning,
these fears may in some degree abate). This the
ancient Philosophy hath well taken notice of, and therefore
well defin’d δεισιδαιμονία by κολακεία, and useth these terms
promiscuously. Thus we find Max. Tyrius in his Dissert. 4
concerning the difference between a <i>Friend</i> and a <i>Flatterer</i>.
ὁ μὲν εὐσεβής, φίλος θεῷ, ὁ δὲ δεισιδαίμων, κόλαξ θεοῦ· καὶ
μακάριος ὁ εὐσεβής, ὁ φίλος θεοῦ, δυστυχὴς δὲ ὁ δεισιδαίμων. ὁ
μὲν θαρσῶν τῇ ἀρετῇ, πρόσεισι τοῖς θεοῖς ἄνευ δέους· ὁ δὲ
ταπεινὸς διὰ μοχθηρίαν, μετὰ πολλοῦ δέους, δύσελπις, καὶ δεδιὼς
τοὺς θεοὺς ὥσπερ τοὺς τυράννους. The sense whereof is this,
<i>The Pious man is God’s friend, the Superstitious is a flatterer
of God: and indeed most happy and blest is the condition of
the Pious man, God’s friend, but right miserable and sad is the
state of the Superstitious. The Pious man, emboldened by a good
Conscience and encouraged by the sense of his integrity, comes to
God without fear and dread: but the Superstitious being sunk
and deprest through the sense of his own wickedness, comes not
without much fear, being void of all hope and confidence, and
dreading the Gods as so many Tyrants.</i> Thus <i>Plato</i> also sets
forth this <i>Superstitious</i> temper, though he mentions it not
under that name, but we may know it by a property he
gives of it, viz.: <i>to colloque with Heaven</i>, Lib. 10, <i>de Legibus</i>,
where he distinguisheth of Three kinds of Tempers in reference
to the Deity, which he then calls πάθη, which are, <i>Totall
Atheism</i>, which he saies never abides with any man till his Old
age; and <i>Partial Atheism</i>, which is a Negation of Providence;
and a Third, which is a perswasion concerning the Gods ὅτι
εὐπαράμυθοί εἰσι θύμασι καὶ εὐχαῖς, <i>that they are easily won
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>by sacrifices and prayers</i>, which he after explaines thus, ὅτι
παραιτητοί εἰσι τοῖσιν ἀδικοῦσιν, δεχόμενοι δῶρα, &amp;c., <i>that
with gifts unjust men may find acceptance with them</i>. And this
Discourse of <i>Plato’s</i> upon these three kinds of Irreligious πάθη
<i>Simplicius</i> seems to have respect to in his comment upon
<i>Epictetus</i>, cap. 38, which treats about <i>Right Opinions</i> in Religion;
and there having pursued the two former of them, he thus states
the latter, which he calls ἀθεΐας λόγον as well as the other two,
as a conceit θεοὺς παρατρέπεσθαι δώροις, καὶ ἀναθήμασι, καὶ
κερματίου διαδόσεσιν, <i>quod muneribus et donariis et stirpis
distributione a sententia deducuntur</i>, such men making account by
their devotions to draw the Deity to themselves, and winning
the favour of Heaven, to procure such an indulgence to their
lusts as no sober man on earth would give them; they in the
meanwhile not considering ὡς μεταμέλειαι, καὶ ἱκετεῖαι, καὶ
εὐχαί, καὶ τὰ τοιαῦτα, ἀναλογοῦσι τῷ κάλῳ, that <i>Repentance,
Supplications, and Prayers, &amp;c., ought to draw us nearer to God,
not God nearer to us; as in a ship, by fastning a Cable to a firm
Rock, we intend not to draw the Rock to the Ship, but the Ship to
the Rock</i>. Which last passage of his is therefore the more worthy
to be taken notice of, as holding out so large an Extent that this
Irreligious temper is of, and of how subtil a Nature. This fond
and gross dealing with the Deity was that which made the
scoffing <i>Lucian</i> so much sport, who in his Treatise <i>De Sacrificiis</i>
tells a number of stories how the Daemons loved to be feasted,
and when and how they were entertained, with such devotions
which are rather used Magically as Charms and Spells for such
as use them, to defend themselves against those Evils which their
own Fears are apt perpetually to muster up, and to endeavour
by bribery to purchase Heaven’s favour and indulgence, as
<i>Juvenal</i> speaks of the Superstitious Aegyptian,</p>

<p class='c011'>Though all this while I would not be understood to condemn
too severely all servile fear of God, if it tend to make men avoid

Formality.</p>

<p class='c005'>To conclude, Were I to define <i>Superstition</i> more generally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>according to the ancient sense of it, I would call it <i>Such an
apprehension of God in the thoughts of men, as renders him grievous
and burdensome to them, and so destroys all free and cheerfull
converse with him; begetting in the stead thereof a forc’d and
jejune devotion, void of inward Life and Love.</i> It is that which
discovers itself <i>Pædantically</i> in the worship of the Deity, in
anything that makes up but onely the <i>Body</i> or <i>outward Vesture</i>
of Religion; though then it may make a mighty bluster; and
because it comprehends not the true Divine good that ariseth
to the Souls of men from an <i>internall frame</i> of Religion, it is
therefore apt to think that all its <i>insipid devotions</i> are as so
many <i>Presents</i> offered to the Deity and <i>gratifications</i> of him.
How <i>variously</i> Superstition can discover and manifest itself, we
have intimated before: To which I shall only adde this, That
we are not so well rid of <i>Superstition</i>, as some imagine when
they have expell’d it out of their Churches, expunged it out of
their Books and Writings, or cast it out of their Tongues, by
making Innovations in names (wherein they sometimes imitate
those old <i>Caunii</i> that <i>Herodotus</i> speaks of, who that they might
banish all the forrein Gods that had stollen in among them, took
their procession through all their Country, beating and scourging
the Aire along as they went;) No, for all this, <i>Superstition</i>
may enter into our chambers, and creep into our closets, it may
twine about our secret Devotions, and actuate our Formes of
belief and Orthodox opinions, when it hath no place else to
shroud itself or hide its head in; we may think to flatter the
Deity by these, and to bribe it with them, when we are grown
weary of more pompous solemnities: nay it may mix it self
with a seeming Faith in Christ; as I doubt it doth now in too
many, who laying aside all sober and serious care of true Piety,
think it sufficient to offer up their Saviour, his Active and
Passive Righteousness, to a severe and rigid Justice, to make
expiation for those sins they can be willing to allow themselves in.</p>

  <h3 id='chap09' class='c016'>ON THE FACE WHICH APPEARS ON THE ORB OF THE MOON <br /> A DIALOGUE</h3>
</div>
<h3 class='c009'>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p class='c004'>Plutarch’s Dialogue on <i>The Face in the Moon</i> is not a
scientific treatise, and its author would have disclaimed any
intention of writing to advance science. It is discussion for
the sake of discussion, the ‘good talk’ of which Plutarch wished
that Athens should have no monopoly, any more than she had
when the Boeotian Simmias and Cebes were among the trusted
friends of Socrates, or, later, when ‘plain living and high
thinking’ could be exhibited in lofty perfection in the Theban
home of Epaminondas. A mixed company, which includes an
astronomer, another mathematician, a literary man, and professed
philosophers (there is no Epicurean here), with Lamprias,
Plutarch’s brother, for president, discusses the movements and
physical nature of the moon, from many points of view. Reference
is made throughout to a previous discussion at which
Lamprias, and Lucius, another of the speakers, had been
present, when a person called ‘Our Comrade’ had dealt faithfully
with the Peripatetic view, endorsed by the Stoics, that the
moon is not of substance like our earth, but is a fiery or starlike
body. This discussion had wandered into mystical theories as
to the moon’s office in the birth and death of human souls, and
her connexion with ‘daemons’. Sylla has joined the present
company with a myth to relate bearing on these deep subjects,
which had come to him at Carthage as a traveller’s tale. Its
production is delayed until the end of the Dialogue, which it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>closes after the manner of a Platonic myth; the phrases with
which it is opened and dismissed may be compared with those
of the <i>Gorgias</i>. This double device, of referring part of the
matter to a former conversation (as the <i>E at Delphi</i> is a recollection
of an old discourse by Ammonius), and part to a new
and strange tale, skilfully relieves this elaborate Dialogue. Some
difficulty is caused by the imperfect, or doubtful, condition of
the text of the opening chapter, as no complete explanation
seems to be given as to the place or time of the former discussion.
Probably this abruptness is intentional, but the text
requires careful attention.</p>

<p class='c005'>Perhaps this Dialogue throws more light on the views about
the solar system accepted or under discussion in the first century
of our era than a scientific treatise could have done. No
reference is made to the great astronomical work of Ptolemy,
which belongs to the second century, and closed most questions
until the sixteenth. The estimate, e.g. of the moon’s distance
(56 earth’s radii) is not Ptolemy’s (59). Some of the geographical
details, as that of the Caspian Sea, seem to show that Ptolemy’s
geographical work was not known to the Author.</p>

<p class='c005'>It may be useful to enumerate some of the simpler of the
accepted views about the heavens :</p>

<p class='c005'>(1) That the earth is a Sphere was known to Pythagoras and
allowed by Plato (<i>Phaedo</i> 110 <span class='fss'>B</span>), and affirmed by Aristotle, <i>De
Caelo</i>, 2, 14, 297 b 18. The moon, and, according to Aristotle,
the stars, are also spherical.</p>

<p class='c005'>(2) That the moon derived her light from the sun was a
discovery due to Anaxagoras (fifth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>).</p>

<p class='c005'>(3) The true cause of eclipses was known to the Pythagoreans,
and is stated by Aristotle, and, with more precision, by
Posidonius.</p>

<p class='c005'>(4) The inclination of the equator to the sun’s path is stated
by Oenopides of Chios (a little after Anaxagoras).</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>(5) That the moon revolves round the earth at a moderate
distance is stated by Empedocles.</p>

<p class='c005'>(6) The other planets (including the sun) revolve round the
earth at a distance vastly less than that of the fixed stars. (No
actual estimate of the distances or sizes is given even by Ptolemy,
who is not able to state a parallax for any, or an angular diameter.)</p>

<p class='c005'>(7) That the planets share in the (apparent) daily motion of
the stars, and also have an (apparent) motion of their own in the
reverse direction was held by Pythagoras.</p>

<p class='c005'>All these refer to physical facts and can be stated without the
use of mathematical language, though many of the discoverers
were expert mathematicians. Gradually, and certainly from
the time of the great astronomer Hipparchus (about 130 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>),
attention came to be fixed upon the accurate mathematical
interpretation of observed <i>apparent</i> facts; in a favourite phrase,
the object was ‘to save the phenomena’, irrespective of physical
and actual fact.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the case of the moon, the two lines of inquiry are less
sharply divided than in that of other bodies. Very correct
statements as to her size and distance from the earth may be
gathered from Plutarch’s Dialogue. A guess is even hazarded
that she is lighter than the earth, bulk for bulk, because of the
action of fire in the past.</p>

<p class='c005'>The mathematical account of the movements of the moon has
its history. As we have seen, it was early realized that she
revolved round and near the earth in a circular orbit. Soon it
appeared that there were irregularities in this movement. The
‘First Anomaly’, a difference of speed observed at different
parts of the orbit, was well understood by Hipparchus. It
could be expressed, so as to ‘save the phenomena’, by either of
two methods, both resting on the assumption that no curve except
a circle was admissible, and both superseding the ingenious
but cumbrous arrangement of ‘concentric Spheres’ known to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>Aristotle. One was that of ‘movable eccentrics’, where the
orbit of the planet was round a point outside the earth, itself
shifting. The other, which prevailed, and was finally adopted
by Ptolemy, was that of epicycles, circles described round
points in the primary orbit, by means of which the planet’s
motion could be retarded or quickened at will, and its position
modified. By this device, the visible <i>movement</i> could be, and
was, recorded with great accuracy, but sometimes at the expense
of physical truth. Thus the epicyclic arrangement for the
moon’s orbit involved, if closely looked into, the consequence
that her distance from us at nearest must be half that at the
farthest, and her angular diameter double! Kepler, after the
work of a lifetime (1571-1630), discovered the cause of this
‘anomaly’ in the shape of the orbit, which is elliptical, not
circular, and substituted ‘eccentricity’ for ‘anomaly’ as the
key-word. Newton (1642-1727) proved that a body revolving
round another <i>must</i> move in an ellipse, with the larger body at
one focus. Thus the wheel had come full circle, and physical
and mathematical inquiry met after two thousand years of
separation. The ‘Second Anomaly’ due to the action of the
sun (the ‘Evection’) was indicated by Hipparchus, worked out
as a phenomenon by Ptolemy, and its physical cause explained
by Newton. The inclination of the moon’s path to the sun’s
was known to Hipparchus as 5°, and the recession of her nodes
was familiar to him. A third anomaly now known as ‘Variation’
is instructive because its discovery has been claimed for
an Arabian astronomer of about <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1000. After an exhaustive
discussion during the last century (1836-71), it seems to be proved
that the claim rested upon a mistake, and that the sole credit
is due to Tycho Brahe (see Dreyer, p. 252). In fact, whatever
in astronomy does not belong to modern science is Greek, after
allowing for what the Greeks may have learnt in early ages from
Chaldaeans or Egyptians. The Romans contributed nothing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>the Indians learnt much from scientific men who accompanied
Alexander, and used it skilfully, but did not advance it. And
the modern makes a really continuous whole with the ancient
Greeks, for it is not only astronomy which should be considered,
but the essential preliminaries, such as the study of the Conic
Sections, which, in its geometrical form, is purely Greek.</p>

<p class='c005'>One authority to whom Plutarch twice refers by name requires
special mention. This was Aristarchus of Samos, who belongs
to the middle or later part of the third century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> He is the
author of a work on ‘The Sizes and Distances of the Sun and
Moon’ which is extant. It was well edited by Wallis for the
Oxford Press in 1688, and more recently (1913) and in a modern
form, by Sir Thomas Heath, F.R.S., who has prefixed an
invaluable history of astronomy prior to Aristarchus. The
book is rigorously mathematical, and contains six ‘hypotheses’,
and eighteen propositions deduced from them. The second of
the hypotheses, ‘That the earth is in the relation of a point and
centre to the sphere in which the moon moves’, is quoted by
Plutarch, apparently as being accepted by Hipparchus. The
sixth, ‘That the moon subtends one-fifteenth part of a sign of the
Zodiac (i. e. 2°)‘, raises a curious point which is fully considered
by Sir T. Heath. That Aristarchus should at any time have
thus exaggerated (multiplied by four) a measurement which
seems open to some sort of simple observation, and have based
good work upon it, seems very strange, firstly, because he must
have considered the matter, (since he is aware that the same
figure may stand for sun and moon); and, secondly, because
Archimedes (287-212 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>), whose knowledge and good faith
are beyond question, says that ‘Aristarchus discovered that the
sun appeared to be about one seven hundred and twentieth
part of the circle of the Zodiac (30´)‘, which is roughly correct.<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c006'><sup>[302]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>The fourth hypothesis runs: ‘That when the moon appears
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>to us halved, its distance from the sun is then less than a quadrant
by one-thirtieth of a quadrant (i.e. is 87°).’ From this is
directly deduced (Hypothesis 6 is not here used) Prop. 7, an
elaborate proof that ‘the distance of the sun from the earth is
greater than eighteen times, but less than twenty times, the
distance of the moon from the earth’, quoted by Plutarch in
c. 10. The fact assumed does not appear to be open to observation;
perhaps Aristarchus, or a predecessor, arrived at it by
comparing the average times taken by the moon over the first
and second quarters of her orbit. The true (theoretical)
figure is 89° 50´. The sequel is very interesting. Hipparchus,
a century later, adopted the result in calculating the parallax of
the sun, which he found to be 3´ of arc (more than twenty times
too much). This was adopted by Ptolemy in the second
century <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>, and remained the official estimate until nearly
<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1700, though both Hipparchus and Kepler had protested,
the latter stating as his opinion that the parallax could not be
greater than one minute of arc, or the distance less than twelve
millions of miles. Shortly before <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1700 improved knowledge
of the orbit and distances of Mars enabled the sun’s parallax
to be reduced to 9-1/2 seconds of arc, and his distance stated
at eighty-seven millions of miles, which is not very inadequate.
It was a great achievement of Aristarchus, though he
led the world into error, to state a reasoned figure at all, and
to think in such mighty units.</p>

<p class='c005'>His cosmical speculation is even more daring. It is known to
us from this Dialogue (c. 6) and also from Archimedes, who records
it in his (extant) <i>Arenarius</i> without comment. Aristarchus
proposed to ‘disturb the hearth of the universe’ by his hypothesis
that the heaven of the stars is fixed, while the earth has
a daily motion on her axis and an annual motion round the sun.
It was a brilliant intuition, possible in an age of comparatively
simple knowledge, which could not easily have been advanced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>when the complexity of the several orbits was increasingly
realized (see Dreyer, pp. 147-8). Dr. Dreyer (p. 145) makes
the interesting suggestion that Aristarchus took the idea from
some early form of the system of ‘movable eccentrics’, and,
further (p. 157), that if that system had prevailed against that
of epicycles, it must have flashed, sooner or later, upon some
bright mind, that there was one eccentric point, namely, one
in the sun, central to the orbits of all the planets.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is to be observed that ‘Heraclides of Pontus’ (at one time
a pupil of Plato’s) discovered the movement of the two inner
planets round the sun. It is possible (as contended by Sciaparelli)
that he believed all the planets to move round the sun,
and the sun round the earth, in fact anticipated Tycho Brahe.
Further, there is a statement that he anticipated Aristarchus as
to the movement of the earth; but Sir T. Heath, who examines
the evidence very fully, concludes that the evidence has been
misread. Aristarchus certainly contended for the diurnal
rotation of the earth, but this was rejected by Hipparchus and
passed out of account for many centuries.</p>

<p class='c005'>The history of the emergence of the heliocentric theory has
a curiously close counterpart in that of the circulation of the
blood. Harvey communicated his discovery to the College of
Physicians on April 17, 1616, but he had kept it back for twelve
years out of deference to the great and deserved authority of
Galen, which it was dangerous to dispute, as Copernicus held
back his ‘Treatise of Revolutions’ for thirty years, because it
was very dangerous, even for the nephew of a Bishop, himself
the Canon of a cathedral far north of the Alps, to question the
findings of Ptolemy. ‘Yet for years the profession had been in
latent possession of a knowledge of the circulation. Indeed
a good case has been made out for Hippocrates, in whose works
occur some remarkably suggestive sentences’ (see <i>The Growth
of Truth</i>, the Harveian Oration of 1906, by Sir William Osler,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>M.D., F.R.S.). Bacon, who ‘writes philosophy like a Lord
Chancellor’—i.e. seeks to eliminate error from facts stated, and
then to apply the law (see De Morgan, <i>Bundle of Paradoxes</i>,
p. 50)—, would have none of the Copernican hypothesis. Nor
would Sir Thomas Browne, though he preferred Dr. Harvey’s
discovery ‘to that of America’. But truth will out, at her
own time and through the ministers of her choice.</p>

<p class='c005'>Behind the horseplay of the Stoics and Academics, on the
subject of the centre of the universe and the laws which light
and heavy bodies obey, there seems to lie some real groping after
a general cosmic law, such as gravitation. Thus the earth and
the moon draw bodies, each from its own surface to its own
centre, and if the earth draws the moon, it is as a part of herself,
once ejected and now reclaimed.</p>

<p class='c005'>There is no direct evidence of the time or place when this
Dialogue is supposed to take place, nor of the date of its composition.
Much of the matter is common to it with the Dialogue
<i>On the cessation of the Oracles</i>, one passage of which has
been thought (by Adler) to be an extract from it. Lamprias
takes the principal place in both, and Plutarch is not present,
at least under his own name. The solar eclipse mentioned in
c. 19 as recent would give a clue if it could be identified. Ginzel
(<i>Spezieller Kanon</i>) has selected three for special consideration,
viz., those of April 30, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 59, March 20, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 71, and January 5,
<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 75. By the kindness of J. K. Fotheringham, Esq., D.Litt.,
Fellow of Magdalen College, who has made the laborious computation,
I am able to state the respective magnitude of these
eclipses at Chaeroneia as 11·08, 11·82, 10·38 (totality = 12).
Thus Ginzel’s preference for No. 2 is confirmed; it was there
a large partial eclipse, and the time of greatest phase was
11 hours 4·1 minutes local solar time. Several stars would
become visible, 66/67 of the sun’s diameter being obscured; a few
might be visible during No. 1, none during No. 3.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>
  <h3 class='c009'>PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE</h3>
</div>
<p class='c004'>1. <span class='sc'>Sextius Sylla</span>, the Carthaginian, mentioned in the <i>Life of
Romulus</i> (c. 15) as ‘a man wanting neither learning nor ingenuity’,
who had supplied Plutarch with a piece of archaeological
information. Elsewhere (<i>De cohib. ira</i>, c. 1) he is addressed
as ‘O most eager Sylla!’ In another Dialogue he declines to be
led into a discussion on all cosmology by answering the question
‘whether the egg or the bird comes first?’ (<i>Sympos.</i> 2, 3).</p>

<p class='c005'>He has a story, or myth, to tell about the moon, which he is
impatient to begin. This story, which he had heard from a
friend in Carthage, is mainly geographical in interest. The
details remind us of those quoted from Pytheas about his
journeys to Britain and the Northern Seas. The whole conception
of the globe is clearly earlier than that of Ptolemy (see
especially as to the Caspian Sea, c. 26). The myth also introduces
us to the worship of Cronus as practised at Carthage, and
connects it with the wonders of the moon, and her place in the
heavenly system.</p>

<p class='c005'>In c. 17 <span class='sc'>Sylla</span> raises a good point, about the half-moon, which
was being passed over.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. <span class='sc'>Lamprias</span>, a brother, probably an elder brother, of Plutarch
directs the course of the conversation, and himself expounds the
Academic view, referring to Lucius for his recollections of a
recent discussion at which both had been present, when the
Stoic doctrines on physics had been criticized.</p>

<p class='c005'>In some of the Symposiacs and other dialogues Lamprias takes
a similar place; in others both brothers take part. Lamprias
probably died early.</p>

<p class='c005'>‘Evidently a character, a good trencherman, as became a
Boeotian, one who on occasion could dance the Pyrrhic war
dance, who loved well a scoff and a jest ... and who, if he
thrust himself somewhat brusquely into discussions which are
going forward, was quite able to justify the intrusion.’—Archbishop
Trench.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. <span class='sc'>Apollonides</span>, astronomer and geometrician; perhaps
the latter would be the more correct designation. In another
Dialogue (<i>Sympos.</i> 3, 4) a ‘tactician’ of the name appears.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>As Apollonius, the great mathematician (living about 200 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>)
was also a geometrician who contributed to astronomical theory,
not himself an astronomer, it seems likely that the name Apollonides
has been coined by Plutarch for ‘one of the clan of
Apollonius’, i. e. a young professor of geometry. Apollondes is
treated rather brusquely by Lamprias, certainly with less respect
than Menelaus. He seems to have cast in his lot with the
Stoics in their physical opinions.</p>

<p class='c005'>4. <span class='sc'>Aristotle</span>, a Peripatetic. Perhaps the name was given to
him to mark the School to which he belonged. In the Dialogue
<i>On the Delays in Divine Punishment</i> an ‘Epicurus’ is a
representative Epicurean.</p>

<p class='c005'>5. <span class='sc'>Pharnaces</span>, a Stoic, who sturdily supports his physical
creed against all comers.</p>

<p class='c005'>6. <span class='sc'>Lucius</span>, an Etruscan pupil of Moderatus the Pythagorean,
spoken of in one place (<i>Sympos.</i> 8, 7 and 8) as ‘Lucius our
comrade’. He is elsewhere reticent as to the inner Pythagorean
teaching, but is courteous and ready to discuss ‘what is probable
and reasonable’.</p>

<p class='c005'>Kepler is inclined to complain of his professorial tone and
longwindedness in the present Dialogue. This is hardly fair, as
he is for the most part reporting a set discourse heard elsewhere,
and that by request. Lamprias has to give him time to remember
the points (c. 7). In c. 5 he asks that justice may be done
to the Stoics. He associates himself with the Academics on
physical matters.</p>

<p class='c005'>7. <span class='sc'>Theon</span> (see Preface, p. xii), represents literature (as he does
in other Dialogues, notably in that on the <i>E at Delphi</i>). He
is a welcome foil to the more severe disputants. In c. 24 he
interrupts by moving the previous question—‘Why a moon at
all?’ and is congratulated on the cheerful turn which he has
given to the discussion. Theon may sometimes recall to readers
of Jules Verne’s pleasant <i>Voyage autour de la lune</i> the sallies of
Michel Ardan the poet.</p>

<p class='c005'>8. <span class='sc'>Menelaus</span>, a distinguished astronomer who lived and
observed at Alexandria. Observations of his, which include
some taken in the first year of Trajan, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 98, are recorded by
Ptolemy (<i>Magna Syntaxis</i>, 7, 3, p. 170) and other writers.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>
  <h3 class='c009'>ANALYSIS</h3>
</div>
<p class='c004'>[The opening chapters are lost. There must have been an
introduction of the speakers, with some explanation as to time
and place, a reference to a set discussion at which some of the
speakers had been present, and a promise of Sylla to narrate a
myth, bearing upon the moon and her markings, which he had
heard in Carthage. This conversation had taken a turn, prematurely
as <span class='sc'>Sylla</span> thinks, towards the mythical or supernatural
aspects of the moon.] But see note (1) on p. <a href='#Page_309'>309</a>.</p>

<p class='c005'>c. 1. It is agreed that the current scientific or quasi-scientific
views on the markings of the moon’s face shall be first considered,
then the supernatural.</p>

<p class='c005'>cc. 2-4. <span class='sc'>Lamprias</span> mentions</p>

<p class='c005'>(i) The view that the markings are due to weakness of human
eyesight. This is easily refuted.</p>

<p class='c005'>(ii) The view of Clearchus, the Peripatetic, that they are
caused by reflexion of the ocean on the moon’s face. But
ocean is continuous, the markings are broken; they are seen
from all parts of the earth, including ocean itself (and the
earth is not a mere point in space, but has dimensions of its
own); and, thirdly, they are not seen on any other heavenly
body.</p>

<p class='c005'>c. 3. The mention of Clearchus brings up the view, adopted
from him by the Stoics, that the moon is not a solid or earth-like
body, but is fire or air, like the stars. This view had been
severely handled in the former conference.</p>

<p class='c005'>c. 6. <span class='sc'>Pharnaces</span> complains that the Academics always criticize,
never submit to be criticized. Let them first answer for their
own paradox in confusing ‘up’ and ‘down’, if they place a
heavy body, such as the moon is now said to be, above. <span class='sc'>Lucius</span>
retorts: ‘Why not the moon as well as the earth, a larger body,
yet poised in space?’ <span class='sc'>Pharnaces</span> is unconvinced.</p>

<p class='c005'>cc. 7-15. To give Lucius time to remember his points,
<span class='sc'>Lamprias</span> reviews the absurd consequences from the Stoic tenet
that all weights converge towards the centre of our earth. Why
should not every heavy body, not earth only, attract its parts
towards its own centre? Again, if the moon is a light fiery body,
how do we find her placed near the earth and immeasurably far
from the sun, planets, and stars? How can we assume that earth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>is the middle point of the Whole, that is, of Infinity? Lastly,
allow that the Moon, if a heavy body, is out of her natural place.
Yet why not? She may have been removed by force from the
place naturally assigned to her to one which was better. Here
the tone of the speaker rises as he lays down, often following the
thought and the words of Plato’s <i>Timaeus</i>, the theory of creative
‘Necessity’ and ‘The Better’.</p>

<p class='c005'>c. 16. <span class='sc'>Lucius</span> is now ready to speak, but <span class='sc'>Aristotle</span> intervenes
with a reference to the view, held by his namesake, that the
stars are composed of something essentially different from the
four elements, and that their motion is naturally circular, not up
or down. <span class='sc'>Lucius</span> points out that it is degrading to the moon to
call her a star, being inferior to the stars in lustre and speed,
and deriving her light from the sun. For this, the view of
Anaxagoras and of Empedocles, is the only one consistent with
her phases as we see them (not that quoted from Posidonius the
Stoic).</p>

<p class='c005'>cc. 17, 18. To an inquiry from <span class='sc'>Sylla</span> whether the difficulty of
the half-moon (i. e. how does reflexion, being at equal angles, then
carry sunlight to the earth, and not off into space beyond us?)
had been met, Lucius answers that it had. The answer given
was: (i) Reflexion at equal angles is not a law universally admitted
or true; (ii) there may be cross lights and a complex
illumination; (iii) it may be shown by a diagram, though this
could not be done at the time (such a diagram is supplied by
Kepler), that some rays would reach the earth; (iv) the difficulty
arises at other phases also. He repeats the argument drawn
from the phases as we see them; and ends with an analogy:
Sunlight acts on the moon as it does on the earth, not as on the
air; therefore the moon resembles earth rather than air.</p>

<p class='c005'>c. 19. This is well received, and <span class='sc'>Lucius</span> refers (a second
analogy) to solar eclipses, and in particular to a recent one, to
show that the moon, like the earth, can intercept the sun’s light,
and is therefore, like it, a solid body. The fact that the track of
the shadow is narrow in a solar eclipse is explained.</p>

<p class='c005'>c. 20. <span class='sc'>Lucius</span> continues his report, and describes in detail
what happens in a lunar eclipse. If the moon, he concludes,
were fiery and luminous, we should only see her at eclipse times,
i. e. at intervals, normally of six months, occasionally of five.</p>

<p class='c005'>c. 21. <span class='sc'>Pharnaces</span> and <span class='sc'>Apollonides</span> both rise to speak. <span class='sc'>Apollonides</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>raises a verbal point about the word ‘shadow’; <span class='sc'>Pharnaces</span>
observes that the moon does show a blurred and fiery
appearance during an eclipse, to which <span class='sc'>Lamprias</span> replies by
enumerating the successive colours of the moon’s face during
eclipse, that proper to herself being dark and earth-like, not
fiery. He concludes that the moon is like our earth, with a
surface broken into heights and gullies, which are the cause of
the markings.</p>

<p class='c005'>c. 22. <span class='sc'>Apollonides</span> objects that there can be no clefts on the
moon with sides high enough to cast such shadows. <span class='sc'>Lamprias</span>
replies that it is the distance and position of the light which
matter, not the size of objects which break it;</p>

<p class='c005'>c. 23. And goes on himself to supply a stronger objection—that
we do not see the sun’s image in the moon—and the
answer. This is twofold: (<i>a</i>) general, the two cases differ in all
details; (<i>b</i>) personal to those who, like himself, believe the moon
to be an earth, and to have a rough surface. Why should we see
the sun mirrored in the moon, and not terrestrial objects or
stars?</p>

<p class='c005'>c. 24. Sylla’s myth is now called for, and the company sits
down to hear it. But <span class='sc'>Theon</span> interposes: Can the moon have
inhabitants or support any life, animal or vegetable? If not,
how is she ‘an earth’, and what is her use?</p>

<p class='c005'>c. 25. Theon’s sally is taken in good part, and gravely
answered at some length by <span class='sc'>Lamprias</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>c. 26. The mention of life on the moon calls up <span class='sc'>Sylla</span>, who
again feels that he has been anticipated. He begins his myth,
heard from a stranger met in Carthage, who had himself made
the northward voyage and returned. Once in every thirty years
(or year of the planet Saturn) an expedition is sent out from
Carthage to certain islands in the Northern Atlantic where
Cronus (Saturn) reigns in banishment. The stranger had
charged Sylla to pay special honour to the moon,</p>

<p class='c005'>cc. 27-29. instructing him as to the functions of Persephone
in bringing about the second death—the separation of mind
from soul—which takes place on the moon, and the genesis of
‘daemons’,</p>

<p class='c005'>c. 30. to whom are assigned certain functions on earth.
<span class='sc'>Sylla</span> commends the myth to his hearers.</p>

  <h3 class='c016'>OF THE FACE WHICH APPEARS <br /> ON THE ORB OF THE MOON</h3>
</div>
<p class='c004'>I. Here Sylla said:<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c006'><sup>[303]</sup></a> ‘All this belongs to my story, and comes <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>920 <span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
out of it. But I should like to ask in the first place whether
you really backed on to those views about the moon’s face
which are in every one’s hand and on every one’s lips.’ ‘Of
course we did,’ I answered, ‘it was just the difficulty
which we found in these which thrust us off upon the others.
In chronic diseases, patients grow weary of the common
remedies and plans of treatment, and turn to rites and charms
and dreams. Just so in obscure and perplexing enquiries,
when the common, received, familiar accounts are not convincing, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
we cannot but try those which lie further afield; we
must not despise them, but simply repeat to ourselves the spells
which the old people used, and use all means to elicit the truth.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. ‘To begin, you see the absurdity of calling the figure
which appears in the moon an affection of our eyesight, too
weak to resist the brightness, or, as we say, dazzled; and of
not observing that this ought rather to happen when we look
at the sun, who meets us with his fierce strong strokes. Empedocles
has a pretty line giving the difference between the two:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>The sun’s keen shafts, and moon with kindly beams.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Thus he describes the attractive, cheerful, painless quality of
her light. Further, the reason is given why men of dim and
weak eyesight do not see any distinct figure in the moon; <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
her orb shines full and smooth to them, whereas strong-sighted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>persons get more details, and distinguish the features impressed
there with clearer sense of contrast. Surely the reverse should
happen if it were a weakness and affection of the eye which
produced the image; the weaker the organ the clearer should
be the appearance. The very irregularity of the surface is
sufficient to refute this theory; this image is not one of continuous
and confluent shadow, but is well sketched in the
words of Agesianax: <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>All round as fire she shines, but in her midst,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Bluer than cyanus, lo, a maiden’s eye,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Her tender brow, her face in counterpart.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>For the shadowy parts really pass beneath the bright ones
which they encircle, and in turn press and are cut off by them;
thus light and shade are interwoven throughout, and the face-form
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> is delineated to the life. The argument was thought
to meet your Clearchus also, Aristotle, no less unanswerably;
for yours he is, and an intimate of your namesake of old, although
he perverted many doctrines of the Path.’</p>

<p class='c005'>III. Here Apollonides interposed to ask what the view of
Clearchus was. ‘No man’, I said, ‘has less good right than
you to ignorance of a doctrine which starts from geometry,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>921<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> as from its native hearth. Clearchus says that the face,
as we call it, is made up of images of the great ocean mirrored
in the moon. For our sight<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c006'><sup>[304]</sup></a> being reflected back from many
points, is able to touch objects which are not in its direct line;
and the full moon is of all mirrors the most beautiful and the
purest in uniformity and lustre. As then you geometers think
that the rainbow is seen in the cloud when it has acquired
a moist and smooth consistence, because our vision is reflected
on to the sun,<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c006'><sup>[305]</sup></a> so Clearchus held that the outer ocean is seen
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> in the moon, not where it really is, but in the place from which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>reflexion carried our sight into contact with it and its dazzle.
Agesianax has another passage:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Or ocean’s wave that foams right opposite,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Be mirrored like a sheet of fire and flame.</i>’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>IV. This pleased Apollonides. ‘What a fresh way of
putting a view; that was a bold man, and there was poetry in
him. But how did the refutation proceed on your side?’ ‘In
this way’, I answered. ‘First, the outer ocean is uniform,
a sea with one continuous stream, whereas the appearance
of the dark places in the moon is not uniform; there are
isthmuses, so to call them, where the brightness parts and <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
defines the shadow; each region is marked off and has its proper
boundary, and so the places where light and shade meet assume
the appearance of height and depth, and represent very naturally
human eyes and lips. Either, therefore, we must assume that
there are more oceans than one, parted by real isthmuses and
mainlands, which is absurd and untrue; or, if there is only
one, it is impossible to believe that its image could appear thus
broken up. Now comes a question which it is safer to ask in
your presence than it is to state an answer. Given that the
habitable world is “equal in breadth and length”,<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c006'><sup>[306]</sup></a> is it possible
that the view of the sea as a whole, thus reflected from the moon, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
should reach those sailing upon the great sea itself, yes, or living
on it as the Britons do, and this even if the earth does, as you
said that it does, occupy a point central to the sphere in which
the moon moves?<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c006'><sup>[307]</sup></a> This’, I continued, ‘is a matter for you
to consider, but the reflexion of vision from the moon is a further
question which it is not for you to decide, nor yet for Hipparchus.
I know, my dear friend [that Hipparchus is a very
great astronomer], but many people do not accept his view
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>on the physical nature of vision, since it is probably a sympathetic
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> blending and commixture, rather than a succession of strokes and
recoils such as Epicurus devised for his atoms. Nor will you find
Clearchus ready to assume with you that the moon is a weighty
and solid body. Yet “an ethereal and luminous star”, to use
your words, ought to break and divert the vision, so there
is no question of reflexion. Lastly, if any one requires us to
do so, we will put the question, how is it that only one face
is seen, the sea mirrored on the moon, and none in any of all
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> the other stars? Yet reason demands that our vision should
be thus affected in the case of all or of none. But now,’ I said,
turning to Lucius, ‘remind us which of our points was mentioned
first.’</p>

<p class='c005'>V. ‘No;’ said Lucius, ‘to avoid the appearance of merely
insulting Pharnaces, if we pass over the Stoic view without
a word of greeting, do give some answer to Clearchus, and his
assumption that the moon is a mere mixture of air and mild
fire, that the air grows dark on its surface, as a ripple courses
over a calm sea, and so the appearance of a face is produced.’</p>

<p class='c005'>‘It is kind of you, Lucius,’ I said, ‘to clothe this absurdity
in sounding terms. That is not how our comrade dealt with it.
He said the truth, that it is a slap in the face to the moon when
they fill her with smuts and blacks, addressing her in one breath
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>922<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> as Artemis and Athena,<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c006'><sup>[308]</sup></a> and in the very same describing a caked
compound of murky air and charcoal fire, with no kindling or
light of its own, a nondescript body smoking and charred like
those thunderbolts which poets<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c006'><sup>[309]</sup></a> address as “lightless” and
“sooty”. That a charcoal fire, such as this school makes out
the moon to be, has no stability or consistence at all, unless
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> it find solid fuel at once to support and to feed it, is a point
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>not so clearly seen by some philosophers as it is by those who
tell us in jest that Hephaestus has been called lame because
fire progresses no better without wood than lame people
without a stick! If then the moon is fire, whence has it all
this air inside it? For this upper region, always in circular
motion, belongs not to air but to some nobler substance,
which has the property of refining and kindling all things.
If air has been generated, how is it that it has not been vaporized
by the fire and passed away into some other form, but is preserved
near fire all this time, like a nail fitted into the same
place and wedged there for ever? If it is rare and diffused, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
it should not remain stable, but be displaced. On the other
hand, it cannot subsist in a solidified form, because it is mingled
with fire, and has neither moisture with it nor earth, the only
agents by which air can be compacted. Again, rapid motion
fires the air which is contained in stones, and even in cold
lead, much more then that which is in fire, when whirled round
with such velocity. For they are displeased with Empedocles,
when he describes the moon as a mass of air frozen like hail and
enclosed within her globe of fire. Yet they themselves hold
that the moon is a globe of fire which encloses air variously
distributed, and this though they do not allow that she has <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
clefts in herself, or depths and hollows (for which those who
make her an earth-like body find room), but clearly suppose
that the air lies upon her convex surface. That it should do
so is absurd in point of stability, and impossible in view of what
we see at full moon; for we ought not to be able to distinguish
black parts and shadow then; either all should be dull and
shrouded, or all should shine out together when the moon is
caught by the sun. For look at our earth; the air which lies
in her depths and hollows, where no ray penetrates, remains
in shadow unilluminated; that which is outside, diffused over
the earth, has light and brilliant colouring, because from its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>rarity it easily mingles, and takes up any quality or influence.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> By light, in particular, if merely touched, or, in your words,
grazed, it is changed all through and illumined. This is at
once an excellent ally to those who thrust the air into depths
and gullies on the moon, and also quite disposes of you, who
strangely compound her globe of air and fire. For it is impossible
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> that shadow should be left on her surface when the sun touches
with his light all that part of the moon which is framed within
our own field of vision.’</p>

<p class='c005'>VI. Here Pharnaces, while I was still speaking, broke in:
‘Round it goes again, the old scene-shifter of the Academy
brought out against us; they amuse themselves with arguing
against other people, but in no case submit to be examined
on their own views, they treat their opponents as apologists,
not accusers. I can speak for myself at any rate; you are not
going to draw me on to-day to answer your charges against the
Stoics, unless we first get an account of your conduct in turning
the universe upside down.’ Lucius smiled: ‘Yes, my friend,’
he said, ‘only do not threaten us with the writ of heresy,
such as Cleanthes used to think that the Greeks should have
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>923<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> had served upon Aristarchus of Samos, for shifting the hearth
of the universe, because that great man attempted “to save
phenomena” with his hypothesis that the heavens are stationary,
while our earth moves round in an oblique orbit, at the
same time whirling about her own axis. We Academics have
no view of our own finding, but do tell me this—why are those,
who assume that the moon is an earth, turning things upside
down, any more than you, who fix the earth where she is,
suspended in mid air, a body considerably larger than the moon?
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> At least mathematicians tell us so, calculating the magnitude of
the obscuring body from what takes place in eclipses, and from
the passages of the moon through the shadow. For the shadow
of the earth is less as it extends, because the illuminating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>body is greater, and its upper extremity is fine and narrow,
as even Homer,<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c006'><sup>[310]</sup></a> they say, did not fail to notice. He called
night “pointed” because of the sharpness of the shadow.
Such, at any rate, is the body by which the moon is caught in
her eclipses, and yet she barely gets clear by a passage equal
to three of her own diameters. Just consider how many moons
go to make an earth, if the earth cast a shadow as broad, at its
shortest, as three moons. Yet you have fears for the moon
lest she should tumble, while as for our earth, Aeschylus<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c006'><sup>[311]</sup></a> has
perhaps satisfied you that Atlas <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Stands, and the pillar which parts Heaven and Earth</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>His shoulders prop, no load for arms t’ embrace.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Then, you think that under the moon there runs light air, quite
inadequate to support a solid mass, while the earth, in Pindar’s<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c006'><sup>[312]</sup></a>
words, is compassed “by pillars set on adamant”. And this
is why Pharnaces has no fear on his own account of the earth’s
falling, but pities those who lie under the orbit of the moon,
Ethiopians, say, or Taprobanes, on whom so great a weight
might fall! Yet the moon has that which helps her against
falling, in her very speed and the swing of her passage round,
as objects placed in slings are hindered from falling by the <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
whirl of the rotation. For everything is borne on in its own
natural direction unless this is changed by some other force.
Therefore the moon is not drawn down by her weight, since
that tendency is counteracted by her circular movement.
Perhaps it would be more reasonable to wonder if she were
entirely at rest as the earth is, and unmoved. As things are, the
moon has a powerful cause to prevent her from being borne down
upon us; but the earth, being destitute of any other movement,
might naturally be moved<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c006'><sup>[313]</sup></a> by its own weight; being heavier
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>than the moon not merely in proportion to its greater bulk,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> but because the moon has been rendered lighter by heat and
conflagration. It would actually seem that the moon, if she
is a fire, is in need of earth, a solid substance whereon she moves
and to which she clings, so feeding and keeping up the force
of her flame. For it is impossible to conceive fire as maintained
without fuel. But you Stoics say that our earth stands firm
without foundation or root.’ ‘Of course,’ said Pharnaces,
‘it keeps its proper and natural place, namely the essential
middle point, that place around which all weights press and
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> bear, converging towards it from all sides. But all the upper region,
even if it receive any earth-like body thrown up with force,
immediately thrusts it out hitherward, or rather lets it go,
to be borne down by its own momentum.’</p>

<p class='c005'>VII. At this point, wishing Lucius to have time to refresh
his memory, I called on Theon: ‘Theon, which of the tragic
poets has said that physicians</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Purge bitter bile with bitter remedies?</i>’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Theon answered that it was Sophocles.<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c006'><sup>[314]</sup></a> ‘And physicians must
be allowed to do so,’ I said, ‘we cannot help it. But philosophers
must not be listened to, if they choose to meet paradoxes
with paradoxes, and, when contending against strange views,
to invent views which are more strange and wonderful still.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>924<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Here are these Stoics with their “tendency towards the middle”!
Is there any paradox which is not implicit there? That our
earth, with all those depths and heights and inequalities, is
a Sphere? That there are people at our antipodes who live
like timber-worms or lizards, their lower limbs turned upper-most
as they plant them on earth? That we ourselves do not
keep perpendicular as we move, but remain on the slant,
swerving like drunkards? That masses of a thousand talents’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>weight, borne through the depth of the earth, stop when they
reach the middle point, though nothing meets or resists them;
or, if mere momentum carry them down beyond the middle
point, they wheel round and turn back of themselves? That <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
segments of beams<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c006'><sup>[315]</sup></a> sawn off at the surface of the earth on either
side, do not move downwards all the way, but as they fall upon
the surface receive equal thrusts from the outside inwards and
are jammed around the middle? That water rushing violently
downwards, if it should reach this middle point—an incorporeal
point as they say—would stand balanced around it for a pivot,
swinging with an oscillation which never stops and never can
be stopped? Some of these a man could not force himself <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
to present to his intellect as possible, even if untrue! This
is to make</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>all from us to the centre down, and all below the centre becoming
up in its turn! So that if a man, by the “sympathy” of earth,
were to stand with the central point of his own body touching
the centre, he would have his head up and his feet up too!
And if he were to dig into the space beyond, the down part of
his body would bend upwards, and the soil would be dug out
from above to below; and if another man could be conceived
meeting him, the feet of both would be said to be up, and would
really become so!</p>

<p class='c005'>VIII. ‘Such are the monstrous paradoxes which they
shoulder and trail along, no mere wallet, Heaven help us! but <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
a conjurer’s stock-in-trade and show-booth; and then they
call other men triflers, because they place the moon, being an
earth, up above, and not where the middle point is. And yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>if every weighty body converges to the same point with all its
parts, the earth will claim the heavy objects, not so much
because she is middle of the whole, as because they are parts
of herself; and the inclination of falling bodies will testify,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> not to any property of earth<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c006'><sup>[317]</sup></a>, as middle of the universe, but
rather to a community and fellowship between earth and her
own parts, once ejected, now borne back to her. For as the
sun draws into himself the parts of which he has been composed,
so earth receives the stone as belonging to her, and drawn down
towards herself; and thus each of such objects becomes united
with her in time and grows into herself. If there is any body
neither assigned originally to the earth, nor torn away from it,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> but having somehow a substance and nature of its own, such as
they would describe the moon to be, what is there to prevent
its existing separately, self-centred, pressed together and
compacted by its own parts? For it is not proved that earth
is the middle of the universe, and, further, the way in which
bodies here are collected and drawn together towards the earth
suggests the manner in which bodies which have fallen together
on to the moon may reasonably be supposed to keep their place
with reference to her. Why the man who forces all earth-like
and heavy objects into one place, and makes them parts of
one body, does not apply the same law of coercion to light
bodies, I cannot see, instead of allowing all those fiery structures
to exist apart; nor why he does not collect all the stars into
the same place, and hold distinctly that there must be a body
common to all upward-borne and fiery units.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>925<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> IX. ‘But you and your friends, dear Apollonides, say that
the sun is countless millions of stades distant from the highest
circle, and that Phosphor next to him, and Stilbon, and the
other planets, move in a region below the fixed stars and at
great intervals from one another; and yet you think that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>universe provides within itself no interval in space for heavy
and earth-like bodies. You see that it is ridiculous to call the
moon no earth because she stands apart from the region below,
and then to call her a star while we see her thrust so many <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
myriads of stades away from the upper circle as though sunk
into an abyss. She is lower than the stars by a distance which

<p class='c011'>For she often fails to clear even the shadow of earth, rising but
little,<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c006'><sup>[319]</sup></a> because the illuminating body is so vast. But so nearly
does she seem to graze the earth and to be almost in its embrace
as she circles round, that she is shut off from the sun by it unless <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
she rises enough to clear that shaded, terrestrial region, dark as
night, which is the appanage of earth. Therefore I think we
may say with confidence that the moon is within the precincts
of earth when we see her blocked by earth’s extremities.</p>

<p class='c005'>X. ‘Now leave the other fixed stars and planets, and consider
the conclusion proved by Aristarchus in his <i>Magnitudes and
Distances</i>;<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c006'><sup>[320]</sup></a> that the distance of the sun is to the distance
of the moon from us in a ratio greater than eighteen to one, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
less than twenty to one. Yet the highest estimate of the distance
of the moon from us makes it fifty-six times the earth’s radius,
and that is, even on a moderate measurement, forty thousand
stades. Upon this basis, the distance of the sun from the moon
works out to more than forty million three hundred thousand
stades. So far has she been settled from the sun because of
her weight, and so nearly has she approached the earth, that,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>if we are to distribute estates according to localities, the “portion
and inheritance of the earth” invites the moon to join
her, and the moon has a next claim to chattels and persons
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> on earth, in right of kinship and vicinity. And I think that we
are not doing wrong in this, that while we assign so great
and profound an interval to what we call the upper bodies,
we also leave to bodies below as much room for circulation as
the breadth from earth to moon. For he who confines the
word “upper” to the extreme circumference of heaven, and
calls all the rest “lower”, goes too far, and on the other hand
he who circumscribes “below” to earth, or rather to her centre,
is preposterous. On this side and on that the necessary interval
must be granted,<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c006'><sup>[321]</sup></a> since the vastness of the universe permits.
Against the claim that everything after we leave the earth is
“up” and poised on high, sounds the counterclaim that everything
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> after we leave the circle of the fixed stars is “down”!</p>

<p class='c005'>XI. ‘Look at the question broadly. In what sense is the
earth “middle”, and middle of what? For the Whole is
infinite; now the Infinite has neither beginning nor limit,
so it ought not to have a middle; for a middle is in a sense
itself a limit, but infinity is a negation of limits. It is amusing
to hear a man labour to prove that the earth is the middle
of the universe, not of the Whole, forgetting that the universe
itself lies under the same difficulties; for the Whole, in its
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>926<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> turn, left no middle for the universe. “Hearthless and homeless”<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c006'><sup>[322]</sup></a>
it is borne over an infinite void towards nothing which
it can call its own; or, if it find some other cause for remaining,
it stands still, not because of the nature of the place. Much
the same can be conjectured about the earth and the moon;
if one stands here unshaken while the other moves, it is in
virtue of a difference of soul rather than of place and of nature.
Apart from all this, has not one important point escaped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>them? If anything, however great, which is outside the centre
of the earth is “up”, then no part of the universe is “down”.
Earth is “up”, and so are the things on the earth, absolutely <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
every body lying or standing about the earth becomes “up”;
one thing alone is “down”, that incorporeal point which has
of necessity to resist the pressure of the whole universe, if
“down” is naturally opposed to “up”. Nor is this absurdity
the only one. Weights lose the cause of their downward tendency
and motion here, since there is no body below towards
which they move. That the incorporeal should have so great
a force as to direct all things towards itself, or hold them
together about itself, is not probable, nor do they mean this.
No! it is found on all grounds<a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c006'><sup>[323]</sup></a> to be irrational, and against the
facts, that “up” should be the whole universe, and “down”
nothing but an incorporeal and indivisible limit. The other
view is reasonable, which we state thus, that a large space,
possessing breadth, is apportioned both to “the above” and
to “the below”.</p>

<p class='c005'>XII. ‘However, let us assume, if you choose, that it is <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
contrary to nature that earth-like bodies should have their
motions in heaven; and now let us look quietly, with no
heroics, at the inference, which is this, not that the moon is
not an earth, but that she is an earth not in its natural place.
So the fire of Aetna is fire underground, which is contrary to
nature, yet is fire; and air enclosed in bladders is light and
volatile by nature, but has come perforce into a place unnatural
to it. And the soul, the soul itself,’ I went on, ‘has it not been
imprisoned in the body contrary to nature, a swift, and, as
you hold, a fiery soul in a slow, cold body, the invisible within
the sensible? Are we therefore to say that soul in body is nothing,
and not rather that Reason, that divine thing, has been made
subject to weight and density, that one which ranges all heaven <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>

Look well to it, my friend, whether when you shift all things
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> about, and remove each to its “natural” place, you are not
devising a system to dissolve the universe and introducing
Empedoclean strife, or rather stirring up the old Titans against
Nature, in your eagerness to see once more the dreadful disorder
and dissonance of the myth? All that is heavy in a place by
itself, and all that is light in another,</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> as Empedocles says! Earth had nothing to do with heat,
water with wind; nothing heavy was found above, nothing
light below; without commixture, without affection were the
principles of all things, mere units, each desiring no intercourse
with each or partnership, performing their separate scornful
motions in mutual flight and aversion, a state of things which
must always be, as Plato<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c006'><sup>[325]</sup></a> teaches, where God is absent, the
state of bodies deserted by intelligence and soul. So it was until
the day when Providence brought Desire into Nature, and
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>927<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Friendship was engendered there, and Aphrodite, and Eros,
as Empedocles tells us and Parmenides too and Hesiod,<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c006'><sup>[326]</sup></a>
so that things might change their places, and receive faculties
from one another in turn, and, from being bound under stress,
and forced, some to be in motion some to rest, might all begin
to give in to the Better, instead of the Natural, and shift their
places and so produce harmony and communion of the Whole.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>XIII. ‘For if it be true that no other part of the universe
departed from Nature, but that each rests in its natural place,
not needing any transposition or rearrangement, and never
from the first having needed any, I am at a loss to know what
there is for Providence to do, or of what Zeus, “in art most
excellent”,<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c006'><sup>[327]</sup></a> is the maker and the artist-father. There would <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
be no need of tactics in an army if each soldier knew of himself
how to take and keep place and post at the proper time; nor
of gardeners or builders if the water of its own nature is to
flow over the parts which need it, and moisten them, or if
bricks and beams should of themselves adopt the movements
and inclinations which are natural, and arrange themselves
in their fitting places. If such a theory strike out Providence <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
altogether, and if it be God’s own attribute to order and
discriminate things, what marvel is it that Nature has been
so disposed and partitioned that fire is here and stars there,
and again that earth is planted where it is and the moon
above, each held by a firmer bond than that of Nature, the bond
of Reason? Since, if all things are to observe natural tendencies,
and to move each according to its nature, let the sun no longer
go round in a circle, nor Phosphorus, nor any of the other stars,
because it is the nature of light and fiery bodies to move upwards,
not in a circle! But if Nature admits of such local
variation as that fire, here seen to ascend, yet when it reaches
heaven, joins in the general rotation, what marvel if heavy <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and earthlike bodies too, when placed there, assume another
kind of motion, mastered by the circumambient element?
For it is not according to Nature that light things lose their
upward tendency in heaven, and yet heaven cannot prevail
over those which are heavy and incline downwards. No,
heaven at some time had power to rearrange both these and
those, and turned the nature of each to what was better.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>XIV. ‘However, if we are at last to have done with notions
enslaved to usage,<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c006'><sup>[328]</sup></a> and to state fearlessly what appears to be
true, it is probable that no part of a whole has any order, or
position, or movement of its own which can be described in
absolute terms as natural. But when each body places itself at
the disposal of that on account of which it has come into being,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> and in relation to which it naturally exists or has been created,
to move as is useful and convenient to it, actively and passively
and in all its own states conforming to the conservation,
beauty, or power of that other, then, I hold, its place, movements
and disposition are according to Nature. In man certainly,
who has, if anything has, come into being according to Nature,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> the heavy and earth-like parts are found above, mostly about
the head, the hot and fiery in the middle regions; of the teeth
one set grows from above, the other from below, yet neither
contrary to Nature; nor can it be said of the fire in him
that when it is above and flashes in his eyes it is natural, but
when it is in stomach or heart, unnatural; each has been
arranged as is proper and convenient.</p>

its lightness; they are mingled and co-ordinated according to
the nature of each.</p>

<p class='c005'>XV. ‘And so it is probably with the universe, if it be
indeed a living structure; in many places it contains earth, in
many others fire, water, and wind, which are not forced out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>under stress, but arranged on a rational system. Take the eye;
it is not where it is in the body owing to pressure acting on
its light substance, nor has the heart fallen or slipped down <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
into the region of the chest because of its weight; each is
arranged where it is because it was better so. Let us not then
suppose that it is otherwise with the parts of the universe;
that earth lies here where it has fallen of its own weight, that
the sun, as Metrodorus of Chios used to think, has been pressed
out into the upper region because of his lightness, like a bladder,
or that the other stars have reached the places which they
now hold as if they had been weighed in a balance and kicked
the beam. No, the rational principle prevailed; and some,
like eyes to give light, are inserted into the face of the Whole
and revolve; the sun acts as a heart, and sheds and distributes
out of himself heat and light, as it were blood and breath. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Earth and sea are to the universe, according to Nature, what
stomach and bladder are to the animal. The moon, lying
between sun and earth, as the liver or some other soft organ
between heart and stomach, distributes here the gentle warmth
from above, while she returns to us, digested, purified, and
refined in her own sphere, the exhalations of earth. Whether
her earth-like solid substance contributes to any other useful
purposes, we cannot say. We do know that universally the Better
prevails over the law of Stress. How can the view of the Stoics
lead us to any probable result? That view is, that the luminous
and subtle part of the atmosphere has by its rarity formed the <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
sky, the dense and consolidated part stars, and that, of the stars,
the moon is the dullest and the grossest. However, we may see
with our eyes that the moon is not entirely separated from the
atmosphere, but moves within a great belt of it, having beneath
itself a wind-swept region, where bodies are whirled, and amongst
them comets. Thus these bodies have not been placed
in the scales according to the weight or lightness of each,
but have been arranged upon a different system.’</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>XVI. This said, as I was passing the turn to Lucius, the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> argument now reaching the stage of demonstration, Aristotle
said with a smile: ‘I protest that you have addressed your
whole reply to those who assume that the moon herself is half
fire, and who say of all bodies in common that they have an
inclination of their own, some an upward one, some a downward.
If there is a single person who holds that the stars move in
a circle according to Nature, and are of a substance widely
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> different from the four elements, it has not occurred to our
memory, even by accident; so that I am out of the discussion,
and you also, Lucius.’ ‘No, no, good friend’, said Lucius.
‘As to the other stars, and the heaven in general, when your
school asserts that they have a nature which is pure and transparent,
and removed from all changes caused by passion, and
when they introduce a circle of eternal<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c006'><sup>[330]</sup></a> and never-ending
revolution, perhaps no one would contradict you, at least for
the present, although there are countless difficulties. But
when the theory comes down and touches the moon, it no
longer retains in her case the “freedom from passion” and the
beauty of form of that body. Leaving out of account her
other irregularities and points of difference, this very face
which appears upon her has come there either from some passion
proper to herself or by admixture of some other substance.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>929<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Indeed, mixture implies some passion, since there is a loss of its
own purity when a body is forcibly filled with what is inferior
to itself. Consider her own torpor and dullness of speed, and
her heat, so faint and ineffectual, wherein, as Ion<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c006'><sup>[331]</sup></a> says—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>to what are we to assign this, but to weakness in herself and
passion, if passion can have place in an eternal and Olympian
body? It comes to this, dear Aristotle; look on her as earth,
and she appears a very beautiful object, venerable and highly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>adorned; but as star, or light, or any divine or heavenly body,
I fear she may be found wanting in shapeliness and grace,
and do no credit to her beautiful name, if out of all the multitude
in heaven she alone goes round begging light of others, as
Parmenides says, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c011'>Now when our comrade, in his dissertation, was expounding
the proposition of Anaxagoras, that “the sun places the brightness
in the moon”, he was highly applauded. But I am not
going to speak of things which I learned from you or with you,
I will gladly pass on to the remaining points. It is then probable
that the moon is illuminated not as glass or crystal by the
sunlight shining in and through her, nor yet by way of accumulation
of light and rays, as torches when they multiply their
light. For then we should have full moon at the beginning
of the month just as much as at the middle, if she does not
conceal or block the sun, but allows him<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c006'><sup>[332]</sup></a> to pass through <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
because of her rarity, or if he, by way of commixture, shines
upon the light around her and helps to kindle it with his own.
For it is not possible to allege any bending or swerving aside
on her part at the time of her conjunction, as we can when
she is at the half, or is gibbous or crescent. Being then “plumb
opposite”, as Democritus puts it, to her illuminant, she
receives and admits the sun, so that we should expect to see
her shining herself and also allowing him to shine through
her. Now she is very far from doing this; she is herself
invisible at those times, and she often hides him out of our
sight.</p>

<p class='c005'>‘The view of Posidonius, that it is because of the depth of the
moon’s body that the light of the sun is not passed through to us,
is wrong on the face of it. For the air, which is unlimited, and

with sunlight and brightness. There is left then that of
Empedocles, that the illumination which we get from the moon
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> arises in some way from the reflexion of the sun as he falls

<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> have their probabilities; but the strongest point on the other
side was either explained away or it escaped our comrade’s
attention; which was it?’</p>

<p class='c005'>‘What do you mean?’ said Lucius. ‘The problem of the
half-moon, I suppose?’</p>

<p class='c005'>‘Precisely,’ said Sylla, ‘for as all reflexion takes place at equal
angles, there is some reason in saying that when the moon is
in mid-heaven at half-moon, the light is not carried from her
on to the earth, but glances off beyond it; for the sun, being
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>930<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> on the horizon, touches the moon with his rays, which will
therefore, being reflected at equal angles, fall on the further
side and beyond us, and will not send the light here; or else
there will be a great distortion and variation in the angle, which
is impossible.’</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>‘I assure you’, said Lucius, ‘that point was mentioned also;’
and here he glanced at Menelaus the mathematician, as he
went on: ‘I am ashamed, dear Menelaus,’ he said, ‘in your
presence to upset a mathematical assumption which is laid
down as fundamental in all the Optics of Mirrors. But I feel
obliged to say’, he continued, ‘that the law which requires
reflexion in all cases to be at equal angles is neither self-evident <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
nor admitted. It is impugned in the instance of convex mirrors,
when magnified images are reflected to the one point of sight.
It is impugned also in that of double mirrors, when they are
inclined towards one another so that there is an angle between
them, and each surface returns a double image from one face,
four images in all, two on the right, two on the left, two from
the outer parts of the surfaces, two dimmer ones deep within the
mirrors.<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c006'><sup>[333]</sup></a> Plato<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c006'><sup>[334]</sup></a> gives the cause why this takes place. He has told <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
us that if the mirrors be raised on either side, there is a gradual
shifting of the visual reflexion as it passes from one side to the
other. If then some images proceed directly to us, while
others glance to the opposite side of the mirrors, and are
returned thence to us, it is impossible that reflexion in all cases
takes place at equal angles. They observe<a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c006'><sup>[335]</sup></a> that these images
meet in one point, and further claim that the law of equal
angles is disproved by the streams of light which actually
proceed from the moon to the earth, holding the fact to be <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
far more convincing than the law. However, if we are so far
to indulge the beloved geometry as to make her a present of this
law, in the first place it may be expected to hold of mirrors
which have been made accurately smooth. But the moon has
many irregularities and rough parts, so that the rays proceeding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>from a large body, when they fall on considerable eminences,
are exposed to counter-illuminations and reciprocal dispersion;
the cross-light is reflected, involved, and accumulated as though
it reached us from a number of mirrors. In the next place,
even if we allow that the reflexions are produced at equal
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> angles upon the actual surface of the moon, yet, when the
distance is so great, it is not impossible that the rays may be
broken in their passage, or glance around, so that the light
reaches us in one composite stream. Some go further, and show
by a figure that many lights discharge their rays along a line inclined
to the hypothenuse; but it was not possible to construct
the diagram while speaking, especially before a large audience.<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c006'><sup>[336]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>XVIII. ‘Upon the whole question,’ he went on, ‘I am at
a loss to see how they bring up the half-moon against us; the
point fails equally upon her gibbous and crescent phases.
For if the moon were a mass of air or fire which the sun illuminated,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> he would not have left half her sphere always in shadow
and darkness as seen by us; but even if he touched her in his
circuit only in a small point, the proper consequence would
follow, she would be affected all through, and her entire
substance changed by the light penetrating everywhere with
ease. When wine touches water on its extreme surface, or
a drop of blood falls into liquid, the whole is discoloured at
once, and turned to crimson. But the air itself, we are told,
is not filled with sunshine by emanations or beams actually
mingling with it, but by a change and alteration caused by
something like a prick or touch. Now, how can they suppose
that when star touches star or light light, it does not mingle
with or alter the substance throughout, but only illuminates
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>931<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> those points which it touches superficially? The circular orbit
of the sun as he passes about the moon, which sometimes
coincides with the line dividing her visible and invisible parts,
and at other times rises to right angles with that line so as to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>cut those parts in two, and in turn be cut by her, produces
her gibbous and crescent phases by the varying inclination and
position of the bright part relatively to that in shadow. This
proves beyond all question that the illumination is contact
not commixture, not accumulation of light but its circumfusion.
But the fact that she is not only illuminated herself but also sends <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
on the image of her brightness to us, allows us to insist the more
confidently on our theory of her substance. For reflexions do
not take place on a rarefied body, or one formed of subtle
particles, nor is it easy to conceive light rebounding from light,
or fire from fire; the body which is to produce recoil and reflexion
must be heavy and dense, that there may be impact
upon it and resilience from it. To the sun himself the air
certainly allows a passage, offering no obstructions or resistance;
whereas if timber, stones, or woven stuffs be placed to meet his
light many cross rays are caused, and there is illumination all <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
round them. We see the same thing in the way his light reaches
the earth. The earth does not pass his ray into a depth as water
does, nor yet throughout her whole substance as air does.
Just as his orbit passes round the moon, gradually cutting off
a certain portion of her, so a similar orbit passes round the earth,
illuminating a similar part of it and leaving another unilluminated,
for the part of either body which receives light appears
to be a little larger than a hemisphere. Allow me to speak
geometrically in terms of proportion. Here are three bodies
approached by the sun’s light, earth, moon, air; we see that
the moon is illuminated like the earth, not like the air; but
bodies naturally affected in the same way by the same must be
themselves similar.’</p>

<p class='c005'>XIX. When all had applauded Lucius, ‘Bravo!’ said I, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘a beautiful proportion fitted to a beautiful theory; for you
must not be defrauded of your own.’ ‘In that case,’ he said,
with a smile, ‘I must employ proportion a second time, in
order that we may prove the moon like the earth, not only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>as being affected in the same way by the same body, but also
as producing the same effect on the same. Grant me that no
one of the phenomena relating to the sun is so like another
as an eclipse to a sunset, remembering that recent concurrence<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c006'><sup>[337]</sup></a>
of sun and moon, which, beginning just after noon, showed us
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> plainly many stars in all parts of the heavens, and produced
a chill in the temperature like that of twilight. If you have
forgotten it, Theon here will bring up Mimnermus and Cydias,
and Archilochus, and Stesichorus and Pindar<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c006'><sup>[338]</sup></a> besides, all
bewailing at eclipse time “the brightest star stolen from the sky”
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> and “night with us at midday”, speaking of the ray of the sun
as “a track of darkness” and, besides all these, Homer<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c006'><sup>[339]</sup></a> saying
that the faces of men are “bound in night and gloom” and
“the sun is perished out of the heaven”, i.e. around the moon,
and how this occurs according to Nature, “when one moon
perishes and one is born”. The remaining points have been
reduced, I think, by the accuracy of mathematical methods
to the one<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c006'><sup>[340]</sup></a> certain principle that night is the shadow of earth,
whereas an eclipse of the sun is the shadow of the moon when
it falls within our vision. When the sun sets he is blocked
from our sight by the earth; when he is eclipsed, by the moon.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>932<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In both cases there is overshadowing; in his setting it is caused
by the earth, in his eclipses by the moon, her shadow intercepting
our vision. From all this it is easy to draw out a theory as to
what happens. If the effect is similar, the agents are similar;
for the same effects upon the same body must be due to the
same agents. If the darkness of eclipses is not so profound, and
does not affect the atmosphere so forcibly, let us not be surprised;
the bodies which cause respectively night and eclipse are similar
in nature, but unequal in size. The Egyptians, I believe,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>say that the moon’s bulk is one two-and-seventieth part of the
earth’s, Anaxagoras made her as large as Peloponnesus; but <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Aristarchus<a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c006'><sup>[341]</sup></a> proves that the diameter of the earth bears to
that of the moon a ratio which is less than sixty to nineteen,
and greater than a hundred and eight to forty-three. Hence
the earth because of its size removes the sun entirely from
our sight, the obstruction is great and lasts all night; whereas
if the moon sometimes hides the sun entirely, yet the eclipse
does not last long and has no breadth; but a certain brightness
is apparent around the rim, which does not allow the shadow
to be deep and absolute. Aristotle,<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c006'><sup>[342]</sup></a> I mean the ancient
philosopher, after giving other reasons why the moon is more <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
often visibly eclipsed than the sun, adds this further one, that
the sun is eclipsed by the interposition of the moon,<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c006'><sup>[343]</sup></a> [the moon
by that of the earth and of other bodies also.] But Posidonius
gives this definition of what occurs: an eclipse of the sun is a
concurrence of the shadow of the moon with our vision<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c006'><sup>[344]</sup></a> ...
for there is no eclipse, except to those whose view of the sun can
be intercepted by the shadow of the moon. In allowing that
the shadow of the moon reaches to us, I do not know what he has
left himself to say. There can be no shadow of a star; shadow
means absence of light, and it is the nature of light to remove
shadow, not to cause it.</p>

<p class='c005'>XX. ‘But tell me’, he went on, ‘what proof was mentioned <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
next?’ ‘That the moon was eclipsed in the same way’, I said.
‘Thank you for reminding me’, he said. ‘But now am I to
turn at once to the argument, assuming that you are satisfied,
and allow that the moon is eclipsed when she is caught in the
shadow, or do you wish me to set out a studied proof, with all the
steps in order?’ ‘By all means,’ said Theon, ‘let us have the
proof in full. For my own part, I still somehow need to be convinced;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> I have only heard it put thus, that when the three bodies,
earth, sun, and moon, come into one straight line eclipses occur,
the earth removing the sun from the moon, or the moon the
sun from the earth; that is, the sun is eclipsed when the moon,
the moon when the earth, is in the middle of the three, the first
case happening at her conjunction, the second at the half-month.’</p>

<p class='c005'>Lucius replied: ‘These are perhaps the most important
points mentioned; but first, if you will, take the additional
argument drawn from the shape of the shadow. This is a cone,
such as is caused by a large spherical body of fire or light overlapping
a smaller body also spherical. Hence in eclipses the lines
which mark off the dark portions of the moon from the bright
give circular sections. For when one round body approaches
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> another, the lines of mutual intersection are invariably circular
like the bodies themselves. In the second place, I think you
are aware that the first parts of the moon to be eclipsed are
those towards the East, of the sun those towards the West,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>933<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> and the shadow of the earth moves from East to West,
that of<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c006'><sup>[345]</sup></a> the moon on the contrary to the East. This is made
clear to the senses by the phenomena, which may be explained
quite shortly. They go to confirm our view of the cause of
the eclipse. For since the sun is eclipsed by being overtaken,
the moon by meeting the body which causes the eclipse,<a id='r346' /><a href='#f346' class='c006'><sup>[346]</sup></a> it is
likely, or rather it is necessary, that the sun should be overtaken
from behind, the moon from the front, the obstruction beginning
from the first point of contact with the obstructing body.
The moon comes up with the sun from the West as she races
against him, the earth from the East because it is moving from
the opposite direction. As a third point, I will ask you to
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> notice the duration and the magnitude of her eclipses. If she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>is eclipsed when high up and far from the earth, she is hidden
for a short time; if near the earth and low down when the
same thing happens to her, she is firmly held and emerges
slowly out of the shadow; and yet when she is low her speed
is greatest, when high it is least. The cause of the difference lies
in the shadow; for being broadest about the base, like all cones,
and tapering gradually, it ends in a sharp, fine head. Hence,
if the moon be low when she meets the shadow, she is caught
in the largest circles of the cone, and crosses its most profound
and darkest part; if high, she dips as into a shallow pond,
because the shadow is thin, and quickly makes her way out. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
I omit the points of detail mentioned as to bases and permeations,
which can also be rationally explained as far as the subject-matter
allows. I go back to the theory put before us founded
on our senses. We see that fire shines through more visibly
and more brightly out of a place in shadow, whether because
of the density of the darkened air, which does not allow it to
stream off and be dispersed, but holds its substance compressed
where it is, or whether this is an affection of our senses; as
hot things are hotter when contrasted with cold, and pleasures
are more intense by contrast with pains, so bright things stand
out more clearly by the side of dark, setting the imagination
on the alert by the contrast. The former cause appears the more <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
probable, for in the light of the sun everything in the nature of
fire not only loses its brightness, but is outmatched and becomes
inactive and blunted, since the sun’s heat scatters and dissipates
its power. If then the moon possess a faint, feeble fire, being
a star of somewhat turbid substance, as the Stoics themselves
say, none of the effects which she now exhibits ought to follow,
but the opposite in all respects; she ought to appear when she
is now hidden, and be hidden when she now appears; be hidden,
that is, all the time while she is dimmed by the surrounding <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
atmosphere, but shine brightly out at intervals of six months, or
occasionally at intervals of five, when she passes under the shadow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>of the earth. (For of the 465 full moons at eclipse intervals,
404 give periods of six months, the remainder periods of five.)
At such intervals then the moon ought to appear shining
brightly in the shadow. But, as a fact, she is eclipsed and loses
her light in the shadow, and recovers it when she has cleared
the shadow; also she is often seen by day, which shows that
she is anything but a fiery or starlike body.’</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> XXI. When Lucius had said this, Pharnaces and Apollonides
sprang forward together to oppose. Apollonides made way to
Pharnaces, who observed that this is a very strong proof that
the moon is a star or fire; for she does not disappear entirely in
eclipses, but shows through with a grim ashy hue peculiar to
herself. Apollonides objected to the word ‘shadow’, a term
always applied by mathematicians to a region which is not
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>934<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> lighted, whereas the heavens admit of no shadow. ‘This
objection’, I said, ‘is contentious, and addressed to the name,
not to the thing in any physical or mathematical sense. If
any one should prefer to call the region blocked by the earth
not “shadow”, but “an unlighted place”, it is still necessarily
true that the moon when it reaches that region is darkened.
It is merely childish’, I went on, ‘not to allow that the shadow
of the earth reaches it, since we know that the shadow of the
moon, falling upon the sight and reaching to the earth, causes an
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> eclipse of the sun. I will now turn to you, Pharnaces. That
ashy charred colour in the moon, which you say is peculiar
to her, belongs to a body which has density and depth. For
no remnant or trace of flame will remain in rarefied bodies,
nor can burning matter come into existence, without a substantial
body, deep enough to allow of ignition and to maintain
it, as Homer<a id='r347' /><a href='#f347' class='c006'><sup>[347]</sup></a> has somewhere said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>When fire’s red flower was flown, and spent the flames,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Which smoothed the embers.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>For burning matter is evidently not fire but a body submitted
to fire, and altered by it, which fire is attached to a solid stable
mass and is permanent there, whereas flames are the kindling <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and streaming away of rarefied fuel which is quickly dissolved
because it is weak.</p>

<p class='c005'>‘Thus no such clear proof could exist that the moon is earth-like
and dense, as this cinder-like colour, if it really were her
own proper colour. But it is not so, dear Pharnaces; in the
course of an eclipse she goes through many changes of complexion,
and scientific men divide these accordingly by time and hour.
If she is eclipsed at early evening, she appears strangely black till
three and a half hours have elapsed; if at midnight, she emits
that red and flame-like hue over her surface which we know;
after seven and a half hours the redness begins to be removed,
and at last towards dawn she takes a bluish or light-grey hue, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
which is the real reason why poets and Empedocles invoke her
as “grey-eyed”. Now, people who see the moon assume so
many hues as she passes through the shadow do wrong in fastening
upon one, the cinder-like, which may be called the one
most foreign to her, being rather an admixture and remnant of
light which shines round her through the shadows, than her
own peculiar complexion, which is black and earth-like. But
whereas we see on our earth that places in shadow which are
near purple or scarlet cloths, or near lakes, or rivers open to
the sun, partake in the brilliance of these colours and offer
many varied splendours because of the reflexions, what wonder <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
if a great stream of shadow, falling upon a celestial sea of light,
not stable or calm but agitated by myriads of stars and admitting
of combinations and changes of every kind, presents to us
different colours at different times impressed on it by the moon?
For a star or a fire could not show when in shadow as black
or grey or blue. But our hills and plains and seas are coursed
over by many-coloured shapes coming from the sun and <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>by shadows also and mists, resembling the hues produced by
white light over a painter’s pigments. For those seen on the
sea Homer has endeavoured to find such names as he could,
as “violet” for the sea, and “wine-dark” and again “purple
wave”, and elsewhere “grey sea” and “white calm”. But
the varying colours which appear on land at different times he
has passed over as being infinite in number. Now, it is not
likely that the moon has one surface as the sea has, but rather
that she resembles in substance the earth, of which Socrates<a id='r348' /><a href='#f348' class='c006'><sup>[348]</sup></a>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>935<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> of old used to tell the legend, whether he hinted at the moon,
or meant some other body. For it is nothing incredible or
wonderful if, having nothing corrupt or muddy in her, but
enjoying light from heaven, and being stored with a heat not
burning or furious, but mild and harmless and natural, she
possesses regions of marvellous beauty, hills clear as flame,
and belts of purple, her gold and silver not dispersed within
her depths, but flowering forth on the plains in plenty, or set
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> around smooth eminences. Now, if a varying view of these
reaches us from time to time through the shadow, owing to
some change and shifting of the surrounding air, surely the
moon does not lose her honour or her fame, nor yet her Divinity,
when she is held by men to be holy earth of a sort and not,
as the Stoics say, fire which is turbid, mere dregs of fire. Fire
is honoured in barbarous fashions by the Medes and Assyrians,
who fear what injures them, and pay observance or rites of
propitiation to that, rather than to what they revere. But the
name of earth, we know, is dear and honourable to every Greek,
we reverence her as our fathers did, like any other God. But,
being men, we are very far from thinking of the moon, that
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Olympian earth, as a body without soul or mind, having no
share in things which we duly offer as first-fruits to the Gods,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>taught by usage to pay them a return for the goods they give
us, and by Nature to reverence that which is above ourselves
in virtue and power and honour. Let us not then think that
we offend in holding that she is an earth, and that this her
visible face, just like our earth with its great gulfs, is folded
back into great depths and clefts containing water or murky
air, which the light of the sun fails to penetrate or touch, but
is obscured, and sends back its reflexion here in shattered
fragments.’</p>

<p class='c005'>XXII. Here Apollonides broke in: ‘Then in the name of <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the moon herself,’ he said, ‘do you think it possible that shadows
are thrown there by any clefts or gullies, and from thence
reach our sight, or do you not calculate what follows, and am
I to tell you? Pray hear me out, though you know it all. The
diameter of the moon shows an apparent breadth of twelve
fingers at her mean distance from us. Now, each of those
black shadowy objects appears larger than half a finger, and is
therefore more than a twenty-fourth part of the diameter. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Very well; if we were to assume the circumference of the moon
to be only thirty thousand stades, and the diameter ten thousand,
on that assumption each of these shadowy objects on her
would be not less than five hundred stades. Now, consider
first whether it be possible for the moon to have depths and
eminences sufficient to cause a shadow of that size. Next,
if they are so large, how is it that we do not see them?’</p>

<p class='c005'>At this, I smiled on him and said, ‘Well done, Apollonides,
to have found out such a demonstration! By it you will prove
that you and I too are greater than the Aloades<a id='r349' /><a href='#f349' class='c006'><sup>[349]</sup></a> of old, not <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
at any time of day, however, but in early morning for choice,
and late afternoon; when the sun makes our shadows prodigious,
and thereby presents to our sense the splendid inference,
that if the shadow thrown be great, the object which throws it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>is enormous. Neither of us, I am sure, has ever been in Lemnos,
but we have both heard the familiar line,<a id='r350' /><a href='#f350' class='c006'><sup>[350]</sup></a></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Athos the Lemnian heifer’s flank shall shade.</i></div>

<p class='c011'>For the shadow of the cliff falls, it seems, on a certain brazen
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>936<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> heifer over a stretch of sea of not less than seven hundred stades.
Will you think then that the height which casts the shadow
is the cause, forgetting that distance of the light from objects
makes their shadows many times longer? Now consider the
sun at his greatest distance from the moon, when she is at the
full, and shows the features of the face most expressly because
of the depth of the shadow; it is the mere distance of the light
which has made the shadow large, not the size of the several
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> irregularities on the moon. Again, in full day the extreme
brightness of the sun’s rays does not allow the tops of mountains
to be seen, but deep and hollow places appear from a long
distance, as also do those in shadow. There is nothing strange
then if it is not possible to see precisely how the moon too is
caught by the light, and illuminated, and yet if we do see
by contrast where the parts in shadow lie near the bright
parts.</p>

<p class='c005'>XXIII. ‘But here’, said I, ‘is a better point to disprove
the alleged reflexion from the moon; it is found that those
who stand in reflected rays, not only see the illuminated but
also the illuminating body. For instance, when light from water
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> leaps on to a wall, and the eye is placed in the spot so illuminated
by reflexion, it sees the three objects, the reflected rays, the water
which caused the reflexion, and the sun himself, from whom
proceeds the light so falling on the water and reflected. All
this being granted and apparent, people require those who
contend that the earth receives the moon’s light by reflexion, to
point out the sun appearing in the moon at night, as he appears
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>in the water by day when he is reflected off it. Then, as he does
not so appear, they suppose that the illumination is caused by
some process other than reflexion, and that, failing reflexion, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the moon is no earth.’</p>

<p class='c005'>‘What answer then is to be given to them?’ said Apollonides,
‘for the difficulty about reflexion seems to apply equally to
us.’ ‘Equally no doubt in one sense,’ I answered, ‘but in
another sense not at all so. First look at the details of the simile,
how “topsy turvy”<a id='r351' /><a href='#f351' class='c006'><sup>[351]</sup></a> it is, rivers flowing up stream! The water
is below and on earth, the moon is above the earth and poised
aloft. So the angles of reflexion are differently formed; in the
one case the apex is above in the moon, in the other below on
the earth. They should not then require that mirrors should
produce every image and like reflexions at any distance, since <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
they are fighting against clear fact. But from those like ourselves
who seek to show that the moon is not a fine smooth
substance like water, but heavy and earth-like, it is strange
to ask for a visible appearance of the sun in her. Why, milk
does not return such mirrored images, nor produce optical
reflexion, the reason being the unevenness and roughness of
its parts. How can the moon possibly send back the vision off <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
herself as the smoother mirrors do? We know that even in these,
if any scratch or speck or roughness is found at the point
from which the vision is naturally reflected it is obscured;
the blemishes are seen, but they do not return the light. A man
who requires that she should either turn our vision back to
the sun, or else not reflect the sun from herself to us, is a humorist;
he wants our eye to be the sun, the image light, man
heaven! That the reflexion of the sun’s light conveyed to
the moon with the impact of his intense brilliance should be
borne back to us is reasonable enough, whereas our sight is
weak and slight and merely fractional. What wonder if it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>deliver a stroke which has no resilience, or, if it does rebound,
no continuity, but is broken up and fails, having no store of
light to make up for dispersion about the rough and uneven
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>937<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> places. For it is not impossible that the reflexion should
rebound to the sun from water and other mirrors, being still
strong and near its point of origin; whereas from the moon,
even if there are glancings of a sort, yet they will be weak and
dim, and will fail by the way because of the long distance.
Another point: concave mirrors return the reflected light in
greater strength than the original, and thus often produce
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> flames; convex and spherical mirrors one which is weak and dim,
because the pressure is not returned from all parts of the surface.
You have seen, no doubt, how when two rainbows appear,
one cloud enfolding another, the enveloping bow shows the
colours dim and indistinct, for the outer cloud lying further
from the eye does not return the reflexion in strength or
intensity. But enough! Whereas the light of the sun reflected
from the moon loses its heat entirely, and only a scanty and
ineffectual remnant of its brilliance reaches us, do you really
think it possible that when sight has the double course to travel,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> any remnant whatever should reach the sun from the moon?
No! say I. Look for yourselves’, I went on. ‘If the effects
of the water and of the moon on our sight were the same, the
full moon ought to show us images of earth and plants and men
and stars, as other mirrors do. If, on the other hand, our vision
is never carried back on to these objects, whether because of
its own feebleness or of the roughness of the moon’s surface,
then let us never demand that it should be carried by reflexion
on to the sun.</p>

<p class='c005'>XXIV. ‘We have now’, I said, ‘reported all that was said
then, and has not escaped our memory. It is time to call
on Sylla, or rather to claim his story, as he was allowed to be
a listener on terms. So, if it meet your approval, let us cease our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>walk, and take our places on the benches and give him a seated <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
audience.’ This was at once agreed, and we had taken our
seats, when Theon said: ‘I want as much as any of you, Lamprias,
to hear what is now to be said, but first I should like to hear
about the alleged dwellers in the moon, not whether there are
any such, I mean, but whether there can be; for if the thing is
impossible, then it is also absurd that the moon should be an
earth; it will appear that she has been created for no end or
use, if she bears no fruit, offers no abode to human beings, no
existence, no livelihood, the very things for which we say that
she has been created, in Plato’s<a id='r352' /><a href='#f352' class='c006'><sup>[352]</sup></a> words, “our nurse, and of <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
day and night the unswerving guardian and maker”. You see
that many things are said about this, some in jest, some seriously.
For instance, that the moon hangs poised over the heads of those
who dwell beneath her, as if they were so many Tantali; while
as for those who dwell on her, they are lashed on like Ixions by
the tremendous speed. Yet hers is not a single motion, but, as <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
it is somewhere put, she is a Goddess of the Three Ways. She
moves in longitude over the Zodiac, in latitude, and in depth;
one movement is revolution, another a spiral, the third is strangely
named “Anomaly” by scientific men, although there is nothing
irregular or confused to be seen in her returns to her stations.
Therefore it is no wonder if a lion<a id='r353' /><a href='#f353' class='c006'><sup>[353]</sup></a> did once fall on to Peloponnesus,
owing to the velocity; the wonder is that we do not

<p class='c011'>men tumbling off through the air and turning somersaults. Yet <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>938<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
it is ridiculous to raise a discussion about their remaining there,
if they can neither come into being nor subsist at all. When we
see Egyptians and Troglodytes, over whose heads the sun stands
for the space of one brief day at the solstice and then passes on,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>all but shrivelled up by the dryness of the air around them, is
it likely, I ask you, that people in the moon can endure twelve
summers in each year, the sun standing plumb straight above
them at every full moon? Then as to winds and clouds and
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> showers, without which plants can neither receive nor maintain
existence, it is out of the question to conceive of their being
formed, because the surrounding atmosphere is too hot and too
rare. For even here the highest mountain tops do not get our
fierce and conflicting storms, the air being already in turmoil
from its lightness escapes any such condensation. Or are we
really to say that, as Athena dropped a little nectar and ambrosia
into Achilles’ mouth when he was refusing nourishment, even
so the moon, who is called and who is Athena,<a id='r355' /><a href='#f355' class='c006'><sup>[355]</sup></a> feeds man by
sending up ambrosia day by day, in which form old Pherecydes
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> thinks that the Gods take food! For as to that Indian root,
of which Megasthenes tells us that men, who neither eat nor
drink but are without mouths,<a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c006'><sup>[356]</sup></a> burn a little, and make a smoke,
and are nourished by the smells, how is it to be found growing
there if there is no rain on the moon?’</p>

<p class='c005'>XXV. When Theon had finished: ‘Well and kindly done,’
I said, ‘to unbend our brows by your witty argument; it makes
us bold in reply, since we have no very harsh or severe criticism
to expect. It is a true saying that there is little to choose
between those who are vehemently convinced in such matters
and those who are vehemently offended at them and incredulous,
and will not look quietly into the possibilities. To begin,
supposing that men do not inhabit the moon, it does not follow
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> that she has come into being just for nothing. Why, our earth,
as we see, is not in active use or inhabited in her whole extent;
but a small part of her only, mere promontories or peninsulas
which emerge from the abyss, is fertile in animals and plants;
of the other parts, some are desert and unfruitful owing to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>storms and droughts, while most are sunk under the ocean.
But you, lover and admirer of Aristarchus that you are, do not
attend to Crates and his reading:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>‘However, this is a long way from saying that all has been
brought into being for nothing. The sea sends up soft exhalations, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and delightful breezes in midsummer heat; from the
uninhabited and icebound land snows quietly melt which open
and fertilize all; earth stands in the midst, in Plato’s<a id='r358' /><a href='#f358' class='c006'><sup>[358]</sup></a> words,
“unswerving guardian and maker of day and night”. Nothing
then prevents the moon too, though barren of animal life,
from allowing the light around her to be reflected and to stream <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
about, and the rays of the stars to flow together and to be
united within her; thus she combines and digests the vapours
proceeding from earth, and at the same time gets rid of what
is scorching and violent in the sun’s heat. And here we will
make bold to yield a point to ancient legend, and to say that
she has been held to be Artemis, a maiden and no mother,
but in other ways helpful and serviceable. For, surely, nothing
which has been said, dear Theon, proves it to be impossible
that she is inhabited in the way alleged. For her revolution
is one very gentle and calm; which smoothes the air, and duly <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>939<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
blends and distributes it, so that there is no fear of those
who have lived there falling or slipping off her. If not this,
neither are the changes and variety of her orbit due to anomaly
or confusion, but astronomers make us see a marvellous order
and progress in it all, as they confine her within circles which
roll around other circles, according to some not herself stirring,
according to others moving gently and evenly and with uniform
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>speeds. For these circles and revolutions, and their relations
to one another, and to us, work out with very great accuracy
the phenomena of her varying height and depth and her
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> passages in latitude as well as in longitude. As to the great
heat and continuous charring caused by the sun, you will no
longer fear these if you will set against the [eleven]<a id='r359' /><a href='#f359' class='c006'><sup>[359]</sup></a> summer
conjunctions the full-moons, and the continuity of the change,
which does not allow extremes to last long, tempering both
extremes, and producing a convenient temperature, while between
the two the inhabitants enjoy a climate nearly resembling
our spring. In the next place, the sun sends down to us, and
drives home through her thick and resisting atmosphere, heat fed
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> by exhalations; but there a fine and transparent air scatters
and distributes the stream of light, which has no body or fuel
beneath it. As to woods and crops, here where we live they
are nourished by rains, but in other places, as far up as round
your Thebes and Syene, the earth drinks water which comes
out of herself, not from rain; it enjoys winds and dews, and
would not, I think, thank us for comparing it in fruitfulness
with our own, even where the rainfall is heaviest. With us,
plants of the same order, if severely pinched by winter frosts,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> bring forth much excellent fruit, while in Libya, and with
you in Egypt, they bear cold very badly and shrink from the
winters. Again, while Gedrosia, and Troglodytis which
reaches down to ocean, are unproductive and treeless in all
parts because of the drought, yet, in the adjacent and surrounding
sea, plants grow to a marvellous size and luxuriate in its depths;
some of these called “olive-trees”, some “laurels”, some
“hair of Isis”. But the “love-come-back” as it is called,
if taken out of the earth, not only lives when hung up for as
long as you please, but also sprouts. Some are sown close on
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> to winter, some in the height of summer, sesame or millet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>for instance; thyme or centaury, if sown in a good rich soil
and watered, changes its qualities and strength; both rejoice
in drought and reach their proper growth in it. But
if, as is said, like most Arabian plants, they do not endure even
dews, but fade and perish when moistened, what wonder,
I ask, if roots and seeds and trees grow on the moon which
need no rains or snows, but are fitted by Nature for a light
and summer-like atmosphere? Why, again, may it not be
probable that breezes ascend warmed by the moon and by the
whirl of her revolution, and that she is accompanied by quiet
breezes, which shed dews and moisture around, and when <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
distributed suffice for the grown plants, her own climate being
neither fiery nor dried up, but mild and engendering moisture.
For no touch of dryness reaches us from her, but many effects
of moisture and fertility, as increase of plants, putrefaction
of flesh, turning of wine to flatness, softening of wood, easy
delivery to women. I am afraid of stirring Pharnaces to the fray <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>940<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
again, now that he is quiet, if I enumerate as cases of restoring
moisture the tides of the ocean (as his own school describes
them), and the fillings of gulfs when their flood is augmented
by the moon. So I will rather turn to you, dear Theon, for
you told us in explaining these words of Alcman,<a id='r360' /><a href='#f360' class='c006'><sup>[360]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>that here he calls the atmosphere Zeus, and says that it is
liquefied and turned into dew by the moon. Probably, my
friend, her nature is opposite to the sun’s, since not only does
he naturally consolidate and dry things which she softens and <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
disperses, but she also liquefies and cools his heat, as it falls
upon her from him, and mingles with herself. Certainly they
are in error who hold that the moon is a fiery and charred body;
and those who require for animals there all the things which
they have here, seem to lack eyes for the inequalities of Nature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>since it is possible to find greater and more numerous divergencies
and dissimilarities between animals and animals than between
them and the inanimate world. And grant that men without
mouths and nourished on smells are not to be found—I do not
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> think they are—, but the potency which Ammonius himself used
to expound to us has been hinted at by Hesiod<a id='r361' /><a href='#f361' class='c006'><sup>[361]</sup></a> in the line</p>

<p class='c011'>But Epimenides made it plain in actual experience, teaching that
Nature always keeps the fire of life in the animal with but little
fuel, for if it get as much as the size of an olive, it needs no more
sustenance. Now men in the moon, if men there be, are
compactly framed, we may believe, and capable of being
nourished on what they get; for the moon herself they say,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> like the sun who is a fiery body many times larger than the earth,
is nourished on the humours coming from the earth, as are the
other stars too in their infinite numbers. Light, like them, and
simple in their needs, may we conceive those animals to be which
the upper region produces. We do not see such animals, nor
yet do we see that they require a different region, nature,
climate. Supposing that we were unable to approach the sea
or touch it, but merely caught views of it in the distance,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> and were told that its water is bitter and undrinkable and briny,
and then some one said that it supports in its depths many great
animals with all sorts of shapes, and is full of monsters, to all
of whom water is as air to us, he would seem to be making
up a parcel of fairy tales; just so is it with us, it seems, and
such is our attitude towards the moon, when we refuse to believe
that she has men dwelling on her. Her inhabitants, I think,
must wonder still more greatly at this earth, a sort of sediment
and slime of the universe appearing through damps, and mists,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>and clouds, a place unlighted, low, motionless; and must ask
whether it breeds and supports animals with motion, respiration <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and warmth. And if they should anyhow have a chance of

<p class='c011'>distant from Britain five days’ sail to the West. There are three
other islands equidistant from Britain and from one another,
in the general direction of the sun’s summer setting. The
natives have a story that in one of these Cronus has been <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
confined by Zeus, but that he, having a son for gaoler,<a id='r365' /><a href='#f365' class='c006'><sup>[365]</sup></a> has been
settled beyond those islands and the sea, which they call the
Gulf of Cronus. To the great continent by which the ocean
is fringed is a voyage of about five thousand stades, made in
row-boats, from Ogygia, of less from the other islands, the sea
being slow of passage and full of mud because of the number
of streams which the great mainland discharges, forming
alluvial tracts and making the sea heavy like land, whence an
opinion prevailed that it was actually frozen. The coasts of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>mainland are inhabited by Greeks living around a bay as large
as the Maeotic, with its mouth nearly opposite that of the Caspian
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Sea. These Greeks speak of themselves as continental, and of
those who inhabit our land as islanders, because it is washed
all round by the sea. They think that those who came with
Hercules and were left behind by him, mingled later on with
the subjects of Cronus, and rekindled, so to speak, the Hellenic
life which was becoming extinguished and overborne by
barbarian languages, laws, and ways of life, and so it again
became strong and vigorous. Thus the first honours are paid
to Hercules, the second to Cronus. When the star of Cronus,
called by us the Shining One, by them, as he told us, the
Night Watcher, has reached Taurus again after an interval of
thirty years, having for a long time before made preparation for
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> the sacrifice and the voyage, they send forth men chosen by
lot in as many ships as are required, putting on board all the
supplies and stuff for the great rowing voyage before them,
and for a long sojourn in a strange land. They put out, and
naturally do not all fare alike; but those who come safely out
of the perils of the sea land first on the outlying islands, which
are inhabited by Greeks, and day after day, for thirty days,
see the sun hidden for less than one hour. This is the night,
with a darkness which is slight and of a twilight hue, and has
a light over it from the West. There they spend ninety days,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> meeting with honourable and kindly treatment, and being
addressed as holy persons, after which they pass on, now with
help from the winds. There are no inhabitants except themselves,
and those who have been sent before them. For those
who have joined in the service of the God for thirty years are
allowed to sail back home, but most prefer to settle quietly
in the place where they are, some because they have grown
used to it, some because all things are there in plenty without
pain or trouble, while their life is passed in sacrifices and festivals,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>or given to literature or Philosophy. For the natural beauty <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of the isle is wonderful, and the mildness of the environing air.
Some, when they are of a mind to sail away, are actually prevented
by the God, who manifests himself to them as to familiars
and friends, not in dreams only or by signs, for many meet with
shapes and voices of spirits, openly seen and heard. Cronus
himself sleeps within a deep cave resting on rock which looks
like gold, this sleep being devised for him by Zeus in place
of chains. Birds fly in at the topmost part of the rock, and bear
him ambrosia, and the whole island is pervaded by the fragrance
shed from the rock as out of a well. The spirits of whom
we hear serve and care for Cronus, having been his comrades in <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>942<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the time when he was really king over Gods and men. Many
are the utterances which they give forth of their own prophetic
power, but the greatest and most important they announce
when they come down as dreams of Cronus; for the things which
Zeus premeditates, Cronus dreams, when sleep has stayed<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c006'><sup>[366]</sup></a> the
Titanic motions and stirrings of the soul within him, and that
which is royal and divine alone remains, pure and unalloyed. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

Island” (for so it appears they call our world), when the thirty
years were passed, and the relief parties arrived from home,
he said farewell to his friends and sailed forth, carrying a complete
equipment of all kinds, and abundant store of provision
for the way in golden beakers. All the adventures which befell
him, and all the men whose lands he visited, how he met with <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
holy writings and was initiated into all the mysteries, it would
take more than one day to enumerate as he did, well and carefully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>and with all details. Listen now to those which concern
our present discussion. He spent a very long time in Carthage.<a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c006'><sup>[367]</sup></a>...
He there discovered certain sacred parchments which had
been secretly withdrawn when the older city was destroyed,
and had lain a long time in the earth unnoticed; and he said
that of all the Gods who appear to us we ought specially to
honour the moon with all our substance (and so he charged
me to do), because she was most potent in our life.</p>

<p class='c005'>XXVII. ‘When I marvelled at this, and asked for clearer
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> statements, he went on: “Many tales, Sylla, are told among
the Greeks about the Gods, but not all are well told. For
instance, about Demeter and Cora, they are right in their
names, but wrong in supposing that they both belong to the
same region; for the latter is on earth, and has power over
earthly things, the former is in the moon and is concerned
with things of the moon. The moon has been called both
Cora and Persephone, Persephone because she gives light,
Cora because we also use the same Greek word for the pupil
of the eye, in which the image of the beholder flashes back,
as the sunbeam is seen in the moon. In the stories told about
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> their wanderings and the search there is an element of truth.
They yearn for one another when parted, and often embrace
in shadow. And what is told of Cora, that she is sometimes in
heaven and in light, and again in night and darkness, is no
untruth, only time has brought error into the numbers; for
it is not during six months, but at intervals of six months,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> that we see her received by the earth, as by a mother, in the
shadow, and more rarely at intervals of five months; for to
leave Hades is impossible to her, who is herself a ‘bound of
Hades’, as Homer<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c006'><sup>[368]</sup></a> well hints in the words,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Now to Elysian plains, earth’s utmost bound.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>For where the shadow of the earth rests in its passage, there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>Homer placed the limit and boundary of earth. To that limit
comes no man that is bad or impure, but the good after death
are conveyed thither, and pass a most easy life, not, however,
one blessed or divine until the second death.”‘</p>

<p class='c005'>XXVIII. ‘But what is that, Sylla?’ ‘Ask me not of these
things, for I am going to tell you fully myself. The common <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>943<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
view that man is a composite creature is correct, but it is not
correct that he is composed of two parts only. For they suppose
that mind is in some sense a part of soul, which is as great
a mistake as to think that soul is a part of body; mind is as
much better a thing and more divine than soul, as soul is than
body. Now the union of soul with body makes up the
passion or emotion, the further union with mind produces
reason; the former is the origin of pleasure and pain, the latter
of virtue and vice. When these three principles have been
compacted, the earth contributes body to the birth of man,
the moon soul, the sun reason, just as he contributes her light to
the moon. The death which we die is of two kinds; the one <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
makes man two out of three, the other makes him one out of two;
the one takes place in the earth which is the realm of Demeter,
and is initiation unto her,<a id='r369' /><a href='#f369' class='c006'><sup>[369]</sup></a> so that the Athenians used in ancient
times to call the dead “Demetrians”, the other is in the moon,
and is of Persephone; Hermes is the associate on earth of the
one, of the other in heaven. Demeter parts soul from body
quickly and with force; Persephone parts mind from soul
gently and very slowly, and therefore has been called<a id='r370' /><a href='#f370' class='c006'><sup>[370]</sup></a> “Of
the Birth to Unity”, for the best part of man is left in oneness,
when separated by her. Each process happens according to <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Nature, as thus: It is appointed that every soul, irrational
or rational, when it has quitted the body, should wander
in the region between earth and moon, but not all for an equal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>time; unjust and unchaste souls pay penalties for their wrongdoings;
but the good must for a certain appointed time,
sufficient to purge away and blow to the winds, as noxious
exhalations, defilements from the body, which is their
vicious cause, be in that mildest part of the air which
they call “The Meadows of Hades”; then they return as
from long and distant exile back to their country, they taste
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> such joy as men feel here who are initiated, joy mingled with
much amazement and trouble, yet also with a hope which is
each man’s own. For many who are already grasping at the
moon she pushes off and washes away, and some even of those
souls which are already there and are turning round to look
below are seen to be plunged again into the abyss. But those
which have passed above, and have found firm footing, first go
round like victors wreathed with crowns of feathers called
“crowns of constancy”, because they kept the irrational
part of the soul obedient to the curb of reason, and well ordered
in life. Then with countenance like a sunbeam, and soul borne
lightly upwards by fire, as here, namely that of the air about
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> the moon, they receive tone and force from it, as iron takes an
edge in its bath; for that which is still volatile and diffuse is
strengthened and becomes firm and transparent, so that they
are nourished by such vapour as meets them, and well did
Heraclitus<a id='r371' /><a href='#f371' class='c006'><sup>[371]</sup></a> say that “Souls feed on smell in Hades.”</p>

<p class='c005'>XXIX. First they look on the moon herself, her size, her
beauty, and her nature, which is not single or unmixed, but
as it were a composition of earth and star. For as the earth
has become soft by being mixed with air and moisture, and as
the blood infused into the flesh produces sensibility, so the moon,
they say, being mingled with air through all her depth, is
endowed with soul and with fertility, and at the same time
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> receives a balance, lightness set against weight. Even so the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>universe itself, duly framed together of things having some
an upward tendency, some a downward, is freed from all
movement of place. This Xenocrates apprehended, it would
seem, by some divine reasoning, having received the suggestion
from Plato. For it is Plato<a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c006'><sup>[372]</sup></a> who showed that every star has
been compounded of earth and fire by means of intermediate
natures given in proportion, since nothing reaches the senses
into which earth and light do not enter. But Xenocrates says
that the stars and the sun are compounded out of fire and the <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>944<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
first density, the moon out of the second density and her
own air, and earth out of water, fire, and the third density;
and that as an universal law, neither the dense alone nor the
rarefied alone is capable of receiving soul. So much then for
the substance of the moon. But her breadth and bulk are not
what geometricians say, but many times greater. The reason
why she but seldom measures the shadow of the earth with
[three of] her own diameters, is not its smallness, but her heat,
whereby she increases her speed that she may swiftly pass through
and beyond the dark region, bearing from out it the souls of
the good, as they hasten and cry aloud, for being in the shadow
they no longer hear the harmony of heaven. At the same <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
time there are borne up from below through the shadow the
souls of those who are to be punished, with wailing and loud
cries. Hence comes the widespread custom of clanking vessels
of brass during eclipses, with a din and a clatter to reach the
souls. Also the face, as we call it, terrifies them, when they are
near, so grim and weird is it to their sight. Really it is nothing
of the kind; but as our earth has gulfs deep and great, one here
which streams inwards towards us from the Pillars of Hercules, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
outwards the Caspian, and those about the Red Sea, even
such are those depths and hollows of the moon. The largest
of them they call the Gulf of Hecate, where the souls endure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>and exact retribution for all the things which they have suffered
or done ever since they became spirits; two of them are long,
through which the souls pass, now to the parts of the moon
which are turned toward heaven, now back to the side next
to earth. The parts of the moon toward heaven are called
“the Elysian plain”, those toward earth “the plain of Persephone
Antichthon”.</p>

<p class='c005'>XXX. ‘However, the spirits do not pass all their time upon
her, they come down here to superintend oracles, take part
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> in the highest rites of initiation and mysteries, become guardian
avengers of wrongdoing, and shine forth as saving lights in
war and on the sea. In these functions, whatever they do in
a way which is not right, from anger or to win unrighteous
favour, or in jealousy, they suffer for it, being thrust down to
earth again and imprisoned in human bodies. From the better
of them, the attendants of Cronus said that they are themselves
sprung, as in earlier times the Dactyli of Ida, the Corybantes
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>E</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> in Phrygia, the Trophoniades in Udora of Boeotia, and countless
others in many parts of the inhabited world; whose temples
and houses and appellations remain to this day. Some there
are whose powers are failing because they have passed to another
place by an honourable exchange. This happens to some
sooner, to others later, when mind has been separated from soul;
the separation comes by love for the image which is in the sun;
through it there shines upon them that desirable, beautiful,
divine, and blessed presence for which all Nature yearns, yet in
different ways. For it is through love of the sun that the moon
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>F</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> herself makes her circuit, and has her meetings with him to
receive from him all fertility. That Nature which is the soul
remains on the moon, preserving traces and dreams of the former
life, and of it you may take it that it has been rightly said:</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>Not at the first, and not when it is quit of the body does this
happen to it, but afterwards when it becomes deserted and
solitary, set free from mind. Of all that Homer has told us
I think that there is nothing more divine than where he speaks
of those in Hades:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>For the self of each of us is not courage, nor fear, nor desire,
any more than it is a parcel of flesh and of humours; it is that
whereby we understand and think. The soul being shaped by <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>945<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the mind and itself shaping the body and encompassing it upon
all sides, stamps its form upon it, so that even if it is separated
from both for a long time, yet it possesses the likeness and the
stamp, and is rightly called an image. Of these, the moon,
as has been said, is the element, for they are resolved into her
just as are the bodies of the dead into earth; the temperate
speedily, those who embraced a life of quiet and Philosophy;
for, having been set free by mind, and having no further use
for the passions, they wither away. But of the ambitious, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>B</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and active, and sensuous, and passionate, some are distracted
as though in sleep, dreaming out their memories of life, as the
soul of Endymion; but when their restless and susceptible
nature starts them out of the moon and draws them to another
birth, she does not suffer it, but draws them back and soothes
them. For no trifling matter is it, nor quiet, nor conventional,
when in the absence of mind, they get them a body by passionate
endeavour; Tityi and Typhones, and that Typhon who seized
Delphi and confounded the oracle there by insolence and force,
came of such souls as these, deserted by reason, and left to the <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>C</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
wild wanderings of their emotional part. But in course of
time the moon receives even these unto herself and brings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>them to order; then, when the sun again sows mind, she
receives it with vital power and makes new souls, and, thirdly,
earth provides a body; for earth gives nothing after death
of what she received for birth; the sun receives nothing,
save that he receives back the mind which he gives, but the
moon both receives and gives, and compounds, and distributes
in diverse functions; she who compounds has Ilithyia for
her name, she who distributes, Artemis. And of the three Fates
Atropus has her station about the sun and gives the first impulse
of generation; Clotho moving about the moon combines and
mingles, lastly Lachesis, upon the earth, lends her hand, and
she has most to do with Fortune; for that which is without
soul is powerless in itself and is affected by others, mind is free
from affection and sovereign; soul a compound and a middle
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='fss'>D</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> term, has, like the moon, been formed by the God, a blend
and mixture of things above and things below, and thus bears
the same relation to the sun which the earth does to the moon.’</p>

<p class='c005'>‘Such’, said Sylla, ‘is the story which I heard the stranger
relate, but he had it from the chamberlains and ministers of
Cronus, as he himself used to say. But you and your friends,
Lamprias, may take the story in what way you will.’</p>

<p class='c004'>(1) c. 1, 920 B. The opening of the Dialogue is abrupt; compare
that of ‘On the Instances of Delay in Divine Punishment’. Many
of the Symposiacs open as abruptly, and there a former conversation
is sometimes resumed by the same speakers. It seems not impossible
that there had been a previous Dialogue on the Face in the Moon,
and, again, that the περὶ ψυχῆς preceded the <i>De Sera numinum
Vindicta</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Wyttenbach reads τῷ γ᾽ ἐμῷ for the MSS. τῷ γὰρ ἐμῷ, but suggests
τῷ παρ᾽ ἐμοί, which seems better. Sylla is not the author, but the
depository, of the myth.</p>

<p class='c005'>For εἰ δεῖ τι ... προσανακρούσασθαι he reads εἰ δή τι ... προσανεκρούσασθε.
The past indicative is required by the τί δὲ οὐκ ἐμέλλομεν
which follows, the reference being to the previous discussion (see
Introduction). The combination εἰ δή or εἰ δή τι is a frequent one.
If δή was altered to δεῖ, the further alteration of the verb would
follow. Sylla’s language is nautical, as in c. 26, ‘Did you really
stop rowing, and back-water on to the received views?’</p>

<p class='c005'>(2) c. 3. 921 A. <i>For our sight.</i> ὄψις is an old correction for ἴτυς
of the MSS., and is required by the context.</p>

<p class='c011'>This poetical quotation is introduced to indicate that the world
is not a mere point, but has sensible dimensions. In literal truth,
the habitable world was held to be twice as long as it was wide
(i. e. N. to S.).</p>

<p class='c005'>The words as to the earth occupying ‘a point central to the
sphere (i. e. orbit) of the moon’ are quoted from the Second Hypothesis
of Aristarchus (see Introduction). It has been proposed (by
Dr. Max Adler) to substitute the name of Clearchus for that of Hipparchus.
But the quarrel of Lamprias is not with philosophers but
with astronomers and mathematicians, represented by Apollonides
and Menelaus. The greatest of them is of absolute authority as to
angles of reflexion, &amp;c., not so when he propounds a physical theory of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>vision, which many find unsatisfactory. For the theory itself see
the quasi-Plutarchean <i>De Placitis</i>, 4, 13.</p>

<p class='c005'>For the words καίτοι γε φίλε πρίαμ᾽ (omitted in the translation),
Turnebus proposed καίτοι γε φίλε Λαμπρία, which is very attractive
as to the letters, but impossible, unless the text be wholly reconstructed,
because Lamprias is himself the speaker.</p>

<p class='c005'>For discrepancies between the mathematically correct theory of
reflexion and its physical application see chapters 17 and 23.</p>

<p class='c005'>(4) c. 7, 924 B. <i>That segments of beams....</i> The sense intended
by the translation is this: A beam is sawn into two segments on
the earth’s surface. The two segments, which at first are separated
by a short interval, move simultaneously towards the earth’s centre,
but in converging, not parallel, lines, and jam each other long
before they reach it. (This is suggested by Aristotle, <i>de Caelo</i>, 2, 14,
296 b 18.)</p>

<p class='c005'>For ἀποκρίπτεσθαι Dr. Purser suggests ἀποθρύπτεσθαι, which I have
rendered; ἀποκύπτεσθαι (Aristoph. Lysis. 1003), ‘to crouch aside’,
seems possible.</p>

<p class='c005'>(5) c. 9, 925 B. Perhaps the line of Empedocles may run ἅρματος
ὡσπερανεὶ (L. C. P.) χνόη ᾄσσεται.</p>

<p class='c005'>(6) c. 10, 925 E. The MSS. have ἀλλὰ καὶ κινητικὸ ταύτῃ διάστημα
τὸ δέον, for which Madvig (<i>Adv. Crit.</i>, vol. i, p. 665) makes the
admirable correction: ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐκείνῃ καὶ ταύτῃ δυίστημα δοτέον.</p>

<p class='c005'>(7) c. 14, 927 F. <i>The growth within.</i> I read αὔξησιν, which is
sometimes confused with ἕξιν. Cp. Ar. <i>Eth. N.</i> 3, 14, 149 b 4.</p>

<p class='c005'>(8) c. 19, 932 C. [<i>the moon ... bodies also</i>]. The words in
brackets have been supplied from the substance of the passage of
Aristotle mentioned in the footnote.</p>

<p class='c005'>(9) c. 19, 932 C. Posidonius’ definition is introduced because
it contains an admission that the moon casts a shadow, and is therefore
an earthlike, not a starlike, body. It has been proposed to alter
σκιᾶς into σκιᾷ, and the construction with σύνοδος could be justified
by Platonic examples (see R. Kunze in <i>Rhein. Mus.</i> vol. 64, p. 635),
but the assumed corruption is improbable. E appears<a id='r375' /><a href='#f375' class='c006'><sup>[375]</sup></a> to read οἷς
not ἧς; the clause introduced by the relative seems to contain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>a limitation of the phenomenon to ‘those who experience the obscuration’,
i.e. those in the track of the shadow over the earth’s surface.
In this case, the words may either have come from a marginal gloss
on τόδε τὸ πάθος, or should be transposed with those words, as
suggested by Dr. Purser. This will be consistent with the account
of a solar eclipse given by Cleomedes (2, 3, p. 172), doubtless after
Posidonius; it is not αὐτοῦ τοῦ θεοῦ πάθος ἀλλὰ τῆς ἡμετέρας ὄψεως,
whereas an eclipse of the moon is αὐτῆς τῆς θεοῦ πάθος, irrespective
of the place of the terrestrial observer.</p>

<p class='c005'>(10) c. 24, 937 F. <i>A lion.</i> Kepler suggests that there was an old
confusion between λῖς, a lion, and λᾶς, a stone.</p>

<p class='c005'>(11) c. 24, 938 C. <i>without mouths.</i> The MSS. have εὐστόμους, but
ἀστόμους is an old correction adopted by W. Pliny, <i>N. H.</i> 7, 2, 25,
quotes Megasthenes for a mouthless people living near the sources
of the Ganges. See also Müller, <i>Fragm. Hist. Graec.</i> 2, 427 (Adler).
For the notion of living by smell cp. Heraclitus (Fr. 38).</p>

<p class='c005'>(12) c. 26, 941 A. This interesting passage should be read by
the side of <i>De Defectu Oraculorum</i>, c. 18, p. 19 F (p. 135 above),
which has a close verbal resemblance, and is perhaps extracted
from it (Adler). Briareus may have been named in the full text
here, as the son of Cronus. In Hesiod, <i>Theogon.</i> 147, he is the son of
Uranus, and so Eustathius on Hom. <i>Il.</i> 1, 403, but a little later on
Eustathius mentions Cronus as his father on the authority of Arrian.
παρακάτω κεῖσθαι of the MSS. is difficult. Adler would read Βριάρεων
δὲ τὸν υἱὸν ὡς ἔχοντα φρουρὰν τῶν τε νήσων ἐκείνων καὶ τῆς
θαλάττης, ἣν Κρόνιον πέλαγος ὀνομάζουσιν, παρακατῳκίσθαι. Dr. Purser
points out that the Straits of Gibraltar were first called the Pillars
of Cronus, afterwards the Pillars of Briareus, and lastly the Pillars
of Hercules (<i>Schol. ad Dionys. Perieg.</i> 64 in Müller’s <i>Fragm. Hist.
Gr.</i> 3, 640).</p>

<p class='c005'>I have followed the reading of Emperius πέραν κατῳκίσθαι,
but without much confidence. Cronus could not well, as Dr.
Purser points out, have been <i>in</i> one of the islands, and also
<i>beyond</i> it.</p>

<p class='c005'>(13) c. 26, 942 C. I venture to suggest that the text may have
run something as follows:</p>

<p class='c005'>Πλεῖστον γὰρ ἐν Καρχηδόνι χρόνον διέτριψεν ἅτε δὴ παρ᾽ ἡμῖν
μέταλλα ἔχων, ὃς καί τινας, ὅθ᾽ ἡ προτέρα πόλις ἀπώλλυτο, κτλ.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>The long sojourn of the stranger in Carthage would be explained
if he owned mines there.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the sequel φαινομένων may perhaps stand for Φοινικικῶν and
χρῆναι for χρηστήρια εἶναι.</p>

<p class='c005'>408 F (p. 110, l. 19). πρὸς δὲ πίστιν ἐπισφαλὴς καὶ ὑπεύθυνος. If
ἐπισφαλής stands, it should rather mean ‘liable to take good faith
(like an infection)‘, a very common use of the adjective and its
adverb in Plutarch. See e. g. 661 B, 631 C. This seems rather a
forced oxymoron here. Wyttenbach doubted, and Madvig proposed
ἀνεπισφαλής, a word said to be found in Themistius.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have followed Amyot, whose version is perhaps more intelligible
than the Latin, but involves the change of θεοῖς to θείοις (Turnebus)
and the transposition of Tempe and Thermopylae. If θεοῖς can be
retained, the reference will be to Dionysus and Apollo, the two gods
connected with the sanctuary (pp. 67, 138, &amp;c.) and the purgation
of the latter at Tempe, commemorated by periodical rites. θείοις
appears to correspond more closely to ἱεροῖς above.</p>

διιστάμενον W. proposes διιπτάμενον. I have, with great hesitation,
followed Herwerden’s μηδὲ νοῦν (Emperius μηδὲ νοῦ χρῆμα), as the
substantive agrees with the participle, but the whole passage is
difficult. ὑπὸ βρίθους ἢ πάχους seems to be out of place (can ὑπό
stand for something equivalent to ἄνευ or to Madvig’s ἀθῷον ὑπό)?</p>

<p class='c005'>In the paper mentioned on p. 54 Dr. Max Adler adduces an

Posidonius. The participle διιπταμένη occurs.</p>

  <h2 id='myths' class='c003'>NOTE ON THE MYTHS IN PLUTARCH</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>The three ‘myths’ which are found in these Dialogues are all
avowedly Platonic; they are introduced and dismissed in Platonic
formulae, and much of the imagery is drawn from Plato. Yet the
treatment is Plutarch’s own, and the style, though dignified and
elevated after his fashion, never suggests an imitation of Plato which
could only be parody. New matter is brought in, mostly gleaned
from the astronomy of his day. The movements of the heavenly
bodies have been an inspiration to later poets of verse and prose:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Minerva breathes on me, Apollo guides,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>And the nine Muses point me to the Bears.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>To Plutarch the subject was rather one of earnest curiosity, as he
turns to account the details and their theological application, read
by him in the philosophers of, or nearly of, his own age.</p>

<p class='c005'>The purpose of the Platonic myth is to carry the argument beyond
and above the region of logic and analysis, into that of poetry and
constructive truth, upon matters where strict proof was impossible.
The reader may be referred to Bishop Westcott’s Essay on <i>Religious
Thought in the West</i>, and to Professor J. A. Stewart’s book on <i>The
Myths of Plato</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>(1) It will be convenient to look first into the myth of Thespesius
in Plutarch’s Dialogue <i>On the Instances of Delay in Divine Punishment</i>
(see pp. <a href='#Page_205'>205</a>-13 of this book). The motive is identical with that of
the myth of Er in the <i>Republic</i>, yet with a difference. Plato gives
us an experience from the world beyond death, granted to one who
had been taken for dead during several days, in order to carry to
a higher plane his argument for the victory here and hereafter of
Justice over Injustice. Plutarch, as a moral teacher and ‘physician
of souls’, concerned to restore individuals who have fallen, and
to keep the falling on their feet, gives us the picture of ‘The Rake
Reformed’, taking an extreme instance of a vicious character
restored to sanity by glimpses of penalties and of bliss beyond this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>life, in order to deter and encourage others under temptation. The
name Aridaeus, changed to Thespesius, ‘The Divine’, as an earnest
of the reformation, reminds us of Ardiaeus the tyrant, in Plato.
The language naturally falls into that of the Judgement-myth in
the <i>Gorgias</i>. It is introduced by a similar form of words:</p>

<p class='c005'>‘Now listen while I tell you a very beautiful story (λόγος) which
you I think will call a myth (μῦθος), for all that I am about to say
I wish to be regarded as true’ (Plato).</p>

<p class='c005'>‘I can tell you a story which I have lately heard, yet I hesitate
lest it may appear to you a myth.... Let me first make good the
“probability” of my view, then we will start the myth, if myth
indeed it be’ (Plutarch).</p>

<p class='c005'>The details in Plutarch are fuller and grimmer, and the language,
though solemn, lacks the stately reticence of Plato. We are often
reminded of words and thoughts in the <i>Eumenides</i> of Aeschylus.
The celestial imagery is vague, and does not seem to suggest any
special source more modern than Plato. It has a general resemblance
to a passage in the <i>Phaedo</i> (c. 58, p. 109 <span class='fss'>D</span>, <span class='fss'>E</span>).</p>

<p class='c005'>‘We, dwelling in a hollow of the Earth, think that we dwell upon
the Earth itself; and the air we call Heaven, and think that it is
that Heaven wherein are the courses of the stars: whereas, by
reason of weakness and sluggishness, we cannot go forth out of the
air; but if a man could journey to the edge thereof, or having gotten
wings could fly up, it would come to pass that even as fishes here
which rise out of the sea do behold the things here, he, looking out,
would behold the things there, and if his strength could endure the
sight thereof, would see that there are the True Heaven, and the
True Light, and the True Earth’ (Tr. J. A. Stewart).</p>

<p class='c005'>The daemons are only mentioned as Ministers or Ushers in the
after-world; there is no threefold division of the man into body,
soul, and mind, only one into body and soul; there is one reference
to Delphi and its oracle, where a popular belief that Night and
Apollo were partners is corrected. An attentive reading will bring
out a resemblance of words and phrases to those familiar to us in the
Sixth Book of the <i>Aeneid</i>, the subject of E. Norden’s fruitful and
convincing study.</p>

<p class='c005'>(2) The beautiful story of Timarchus, the young friend of Socrates’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>son, who passed into a trance in the cave of Trophonius, and saw
things of the unseen world which were to be fully revealed to him
three months later, i. e. in actual death, comes into the Dialogue
<i>On the Genius of Socrates</i> (pp. 36-40) to explain the special correspondence
during life between the God and those gifted souls who possess
mind, and become daemons or spirits after death. Here the three-fold
division into body, soul, and mind (see p. 303) is maintained.
A practical application of the myth is drawn by Theanor, the young
Pythagorean visitor.</p>

<p class='c005'>As the supposed Dialogue takes place in <span class='fss'>B. C.</span> 378, we do not expect
to find in it the astronomy of Plutarch’s day, though he would not
have shrunk from any anachronism. The general imagery is again
that of the <i>Phaedo</i>, but there is a sea on which circular bodies, the
stars which are men’s souls, float. The current which bears them
is circular, yet not completely circular, not ending in the point where
it started, but describing a continuous spiral (just as the moon does
with reference to the earth’s path). This sea is inclined to the middle
and highest point of the firmament by ‘a little less than eight-ninths
of the whole’. This is puzzling; it may suggest the inclination
of the ecliptic to the equator, or, again, that of the Milky Way to
the ecliptic. Doubtless some explanation will be forthcoming. An
interesting detail is ‘Styx, a way to Hades’, clearly the shadow in
a lunar eclipse, since the moon ‘only avoids Styx by a slight elevation,
and is caught once in one hundred and seventy-seven secondary
measures’, the exact number of periods of twenty-four hours contained
in six lunar months, the normal interval between two eclipses (see
p. 286). ‘Secondary measures’ is a curious expression, since Plutarch
elsewhere (Plat. Quaest. 3, p. 1006 <span class='fss'>E</span>) calls periods of a day and
a night ‘the primary measures’. It seems not impossible that
δευτέροις here has replaced some word which the scribe could not
make out, such as νυχθημέροις. We have the four principles of
birth and death, as in the <i>Face in the Moon</i>; only there Clotho
takes the moon for her sphere of office, and Lachesis the earth, here
Lachesis takes the moon, Clotho the sun, Atropus the ‘unseen’.
Neither list agrees with the assignment of functions by Xenocrates
(see the end of Dr. M. Adler’s Dissertation mentioned below).</p>

<p class='c005'>(3) Sylla’s tale in the <i>Face in the Moon</i> (pp. 299-308), a traveller’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>story picked up in Carthage from one of those curious characters found
on the outer margin of the Greek world in whom Plutarch delighted,
is brought in with admirable dramatic fitness, shown in Sylla’s eagerness
to produce it at the very outset, in the preparation for it by
the skirmish between Theon and Lamprias, and in the vivacity of
the narrative. It is dismissed with a Platonic formula:</p>

<p class='c005'>‘Such is the story which I heard the stranger relate.... But you and
your friends, Lamprias, may take the story in what way you will.’
Compare: ‘I am persuaded, O Callicles, that these things that are
told are true.... Perchance this shall seem to you an old wife’s fable,
and thou wilt despise it: well mightest thou despise it, if by searching
we could find out aught better and truer’ (<i>Gorgias</i>, 526 <span class='fss'>D</span>, 527 <span class='fss'>A</span>).
The astronomy of the myth is in the main that of the preceding
Dialogue, and Sylla shows considerable familiarity with Plato and
also with Xenocrates. It is perhaps noticeable how little interest
Plutarch shows in geographical detail, contenting himself with such
vague and antiquated views as sufficed for a setting to the story.
He appears not to name Pytheas at all in the <i>Lives</i>, and only once
(on a question of the tides) in the <i>Moralia</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>The whole Dialogue has been the subject of a careful study by
Dr. Max Adler of Vienna (<i>Dissertationes Vindobonenses</i>, 1910). Without
entering into his general view of the structure, we may observe
that Dr. Adler seems to be very successful in establishing the close
connexion between it and the Dialogue <i>On the Cessation of the Oracles</i>,
which he is probably right—though he reserves the proofs—in regarding
as based upon it, and later in date. This comes out especially in
the passages about the captivity of Cronus (cp. p. 301 with pp.
135-6), and the argument about ‘the Middle’ (cp. p. 270 with p. 144).
He produces a happy quotation from Maximus Tyrius to establish
beyond doubt that the source of an important passage about mind
(pp. 271-2) was in Posidonius. His general conclusion as to the
myth, is that it too is in the main from Posidonius, and that when
Plutarch draws upon Xenocrates, it is through Posidonius. The latter
appears to have been a writer of great industry and encyclopaedic
learning, quoted as an authority on matters of history, physical geography,
and what we should now call anthropology; not an original
force in Philosophy, but successful in reconciling systems and making
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>them available for human needs; one the aim of whose life-work was,
in the words of one of his most recent exponents, <i>to make men at home
in the universe</i> (<i>Stoics and Sceptics</i>, by Edwyn Bevan, p. 98).</p>

<p class='c005'>Any one who will read Sylla’s myth, with a good map of the moon’s
surface before him, will be able to locate for himself the ‘Gulf of
Hecate’, and the long valleys leading to the Elysian plains, which,
on her side remote from earth, enjoy diffused sunlight. There need
be no idea of shafts or tunnels driven through the solid body of the
moon.</p>

<p class='c005'>Cicero’s <i>Dream of Scipio</i>, written more than a century before
Plutarch’s Dialogue, and also drawn from Posidonius, will be found
an admirable companion piece, enforcing, in language of singular
beauty and elevation, those duties to country and ancestors which
find inadequate expression in the Greek thought of the first century
of our era.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>
  <h2 id='chap10' class='c003'>NOTE ON THE PLURALITY OF WORLDS AND THE FIVE REGULAR SOLIDS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>The opinion that our World, or universe, is not the only one in
the Whole, is attributed, in general terms, to many of the early
Greek philosophers, notably to Anaximander. The exact meaning
of a ‘Cosmos’, in this connexion, is perhaps not easy to fix. Aristotle
is clear that the circle of the fixed stars is one and constant,
but the author of the Stoical treatise on the Cosmos, found among
his works, takes stars to be a part of the (one) Cosmos. An earth,
such as ours with her atmosphere and moon, is essential, and a sun,
or access to sunlight, and perhaps some planets. In the <i>Dream
of Scipio</i> our solar system, with the earth in its centre, is described
with great distinctness as a unit in space. The planets are always
regarded as luminous points, stars somewhat out of place (see p. <a href='#Page_268'>268</a>),
possessing no definite magnitude or solid substance.</p>

<p class='c005'>In theory the number of Cosmi might be infinite, but a shrinking
from the vague ‘Infinity’, in later times associated with the Epicureans,
led Plato, for instance, to restrict the number to a possible
five. That he based this number upon that of the five regular
solids may seem fanciful, but the solid angles and forms observed in
crystals might reasonably suggest the hypothesis that the ultimate
constituents of the crust of the earth would be found in the most
perfect solid structures known to theory. In theory there is much
that is attractive in these five solids. To one coming fresh from
a study of Plane Polygonal Figures, which exist in infinite number,
and, when regular, approximate more and more closely to the Plane
Circle, it comes as a surprise to find that, in the next higher degree,
the number of solid bodies so approximating to the Sphere is five
only. Again, it seems almost a paradox that, of these five, the
nearest approximation to the Sphere is attained, not by the body with
twenty fine faces, but by that which shews only twelve, and those
comparatively blunted and unshapely (pentagons). It was perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>from such considerations that the Dodecahedron was held of special
importance by the Pythagoreans. Plato’s study of the several faces
of these solids, as available for construction or reconstruction of
a world, leaves nothing to be desired, assuming that a solid body
can be built out of plane figures, an assumption which appears to
belong to the same habit of thought as that which makes the point
the square of unity, and the lineal measure corresponding to the
number two the first rectangle. As the pentagon defies the analysis
available for the equilateral triangle or for the square, the Dodecahedron
remains over, a model or pattern of a stitch-work world, as
viewed from outside (<i>Phaedo</i> 110 B and <i>Timaeus</i> 55 C; see also
Burnet’s <i>Early Greek Philosophy</i>, p. 341 foll.). It may not be amiss
to be reminded that Kepler, mathematician as well as astronomer,
spent many toilsome years in the endeavour to arrange the members
of our solar system upon a plan based on the five solids. ‘If
Kepler went out “to seek his father’s asses”, he found a kingdom, for
it was in the course of these speculations, and through them, that he
discovered not only his own “Third Law”, but also the truth, overlooked
by Copernicus, that the orbit of each planet lies in a plane
which passes through the centre of the sun.’ (Dreyer, <i>Planetary
Systems</i>, p. 410.)</p>

<p class='c005'>The discussion of the plurality of worlds, in the modern sense,
begins with the very attractive work of Fontenelle, brought out,
in its original form, in 1686, a year before Newton’s <i>Principia</i>, being
a series of conversations between the Author and a witty and accomplished
Marquise, as to the habitability of the several members of the
solar system. The argument which followed is distinguished by
many great names, those of Newton himself, Bentley, Huyghens,
the Herschels, Dr. Chalmers, till it was brought to a head in the
middle of the nineteenth century by Dr. Whewell and Sir David
Brewster, writing respectively against and for the hypothesis. The
subject was then one (as readers of Anthony Trollope will remember)
upon which any one might be called upon to take a side in a London
drawing-room. In more recent times interest has been concentrated
upon Mars, who now possesses the distinction of having two satellites.
We are only concerned to invite the reader to compare the religious
argument addressed to the Stoics by Plutarch (p. 142 foll.) with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>religious argument drawn by Dr. Chalmers and Sir David Brewster
from the enrichment of the providential scheme for man upon our
earth which would follow the conception of other earths tenanted by
other beings perhaps of a higher order.</p>

<p class='c005'>But it is natural that any such speculation should begin with the
moon, and in fact we find the question of her habitability discussed
by Theon and by Lamprias (pp. 293-9). With the later treatises on
this subject, beginning with Lucian’s witty flight of fancy, we are not
concerned. But an exception must be made for the very able works
of Savinien de Cyrano, known to us as Cyrano de Bergerac, whose
<i>Histoire comique des États et Empires de la Lune</i> appeared, probably,
in 1650, and was followed by a similar work about the sun. Cyrano
appears to be familiar with Plutarch: thus he meets in the moon
the ‘daemon of Socrates’, who has also been the tutelary spirit of
Epaminondas, of Cato of Utica, and of Brutus. The idea (due in the
first place to Heraclitus) of being fed on smells, is worked out with
much vivacity. But with so original and daring a writer, it is not
quite easy to settle how much is due to any hint from others and how
much to himself. A modern reader will not need to be reminded
that Cyrano was not a person of whom it was wise to give an outspoken
opinion in his lifetime. But I had wished to speak with
nothing but respect of a man of real learning and genius, who, from
whatever cause, did not bring to perfection any work worthy of
himself.</p>
